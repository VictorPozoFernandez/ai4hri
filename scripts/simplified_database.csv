55,okay thank you have a good afternoon
56,help me 
56,yes how can I help you
56,I would like to know if there are some special features found in this sony camera

56,I would like a good camera for me because I'm interested in photography so would you recommend this camera
56,if your new in photography this is good because it also has manual settings so you can also practice the manual settings
56,what about iso
56,3200 ISO
56,which cameras is this canon 
56,that is a full manual DSLR camera
56,is this camera better than the previous one
56,yes it's better
56,and how about the  sensor
56,full frame camera
56,any other color
56,no it comes only in Black
56,"let me take a look at another one, thank you"
56,you're welcome
57,hello I am looking for a camera where it has a you know I'm a nice you know why I so smart because I usually go out at night with my friend so you know. you know why are the cameras so  could you suggest me which one is the best
57,"this sony alpha is an excellent camera takes top quality photographs, the iso is up to 3200. it can take good family photos and in general city low light conditions"
57,how about the shooter speed
57,the shutter speed goes up to 1000 in a second but it can go as low as 30 seconds so you got some creative control if a different effects
57,really I said what about the price
57,this is only $550 to get a full professional camera which would be the nearest you would come for competing with picture quality you'd be four or five times that price
57,I see you know what bike today I just want to roll around so thanks so much for your detailed explanation I will come back because I'm not just going to buy the today so later to talk but thanks so much for your time now
57,anytime come back anytime we can talk about some more things to do with the camera and maybe take it out and give a bit of a gun
57,and what about this canon. It has wide range or is it like a very narrow
57,It goes from 50 ISO  up to 6400 so for the top quality shots on a tripod it's fantastic results a really great in low light
57,and wahat about its sensor.
57,This is a full frame CMOS sensor so it's as big as the sensor get in these regular DSLR's
58,hello good morning
58,hi how can I help
58,I want to look at the new cameras that you have
58,we have three new models in store at the moment we have the full professional model we have the sociable camera for your family and friends we have a semi pro model pictures you take
58,I like to take a good picture of the other insects and plants and everything but I'm still question I miss her so I had no name that's too much
58,let's have a look at the Sony a6000 it takes pictures almost as good as itself and professional cameras in some situations it can be accepted for print publication is that good but it's only $550 supported the price the top professional camera so great pictures interchangeable lenses but some compromises
58,um yeah actually I think that's a more my type of come out but what are those compromises
58,first it's a mirrorless camera so it's a bit like having an extra element in the length of the light is going to pass through one more thing before it reaches the sensor.  Also also it has no pulp mode serve the slowest shutter speed on here is 30 seconds but that's your limit you can't go to bulb mode and keep it open for an hour or two
58,I think that's alright for me yeah yeah that's pretty much what I'm going to use it for but how much does it cost again
58,this is only $550 and it comes with a basic lens already dilating to seventy Zoom
58,very good and can I use also other lenses with it
58,it's this wide range of lenses to go with this camera and more being devised all the time we have a brochure that describes those
58,okay thank you I will take a look at that and then I'll let you know thank you very much for helping me anytime
58,anytime any questions come in anytime and we'll see you later have a good afternoon
