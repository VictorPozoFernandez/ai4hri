132,I want something that's light and attractive
132,"I see, what sort of pictures do you like to take?"
132,uh for family vacation for example so good lighting and lots of motion I guess
132,your family likes to travel a lot?
132,yes they do
132,"we have a very lightweight camera that also looks very stylish and it has a lot of presets and its various views, please come and have a look at this one here"
132,you might like to hold it
132,I see
132,"it's very  lightweight and it has 18 preset mode, so wherever you go, you don't have to think too much about the exposure, you can say we are at the beach, we are at the snow, and you get a great picture every time"
132,that sounds great how much does this cost
132,"it's only $68 and it gets very high-resolution photographs too, it's great value for the price"
132,how many megapixels
132,20.1 megapixels
132,that's great thank you for your help
132,is there anything else I can help you with today?
132,that will be all thank you
132,thanks for your time please have a good afternoon
133,excuse me
133,good afternoon how can I help
133,how does this camera perform on low lighting
133,"this is one of the best cameras we have for low light, because of 6400 ISO that's very little noise in the picture and it comes through in a very stable way"
133,what about the exposure what can it handle
133,anything
133,how much Freedom do you have with this like what what can I set according to my liking
133,"this is a top-end manual camera so really it's limited by your imagination, as long as you are able to move your exposure around change your shutter speed, or move to a bulb setting, you have full control in all circumstances, this camera offers that"
133,that sounds great what about the price
133,"it is a high end professional camera and you will see already we are selling the body only, so we would talk about the lens separately, the body itself is $2000"
133,I see do you have anything in this type that's a little more reasonably priced
133,"yes of course, you want to come and have a look at the Sony, this is sold as a complete camera, it's rather cheaper in some ways the performances different, because you won't go so aggressively in low-light but at the same time it has a lot of creative control"
133,"$550, for the amount of creative control excellent value for the amount of price point"
133,thank you for your help
133,thank you have a good afternoon
134,good afternoon I can see you have been admiring our cameras
134,good afternoon can you tell me more about this model
134,"this is a high-end professional model, you can see we are selling  body only,we talk about the lens separately because the people who buy this are looking for full creative control, you can do anything you want photographically with this camera, but it does come at a price"
134,how much does it weight
134,"the body alone is about 1 kilograms and then the lens can be anything from half a kilogram up to sky's the limit, they also makes some lenses maybe 100 kilograms and some of them have this camera mount"
134,I see does it perform well with a lot of motion
134,that's one of its strong points when we moved from film into digital there a lot of problems with trying to catch motion in a natural way in a lot of different things you see sometimes in digital photos have because of that this camera is one of the first to show good natural motion
134,is it equipped with autofocus
134,"what sort of auto focus do you like? it has a number of different ways of handling autofocus and processing information, and it works on 61 different points on the sensor for each of those different modes"
134,great sounds like a great camera
134,"it is a fantastic camera, can I ask what sort of photography you do?"
134,pretty much anything I like diversity I like taking pictures of different stuff so it sounds like a well-rounded camera that might suit my needs
134,"yes it does actually sound that. we have a lot of other cameras that perform at much lower price and still get a good picture but they are no where near as versatile with this total creative freedom. would you like to talk about lenses, the kind of lenses we carry that would go with this camera?"
134,I think I'll think a little bit more about this model first thank you for your help
134,"before you go I have some information here that will give you a few more details about the camera and some things you can read about that, also there are some things from some of the competitors but you can maybe do some comparisons"
134,helpful thank you
134,thank you please have a good afternoon
135,excuse me
135,good afternoon how can I help
135,how many colors this model came in
135,"this comes in 5 colors, we have purple, pink, black, silver, and red color in stock now"
135,I see how much does it cost
135,it's only $68
135,powerful is it how many megapixels can it shoot
135,"it shoots 20 megapixels so if you want to make large pictures for your wall, for example, you'll get a nice clear shot out of it"
135,does it have any preset mode ready to use
135,"this camera is built around preset mode, it has a number of options but you can say what sort of location you're in, and it will give you the best result for that location, it will also let you retouch and shift colors with some presets there that look fantastic and very easy to use"
135,is it hard to operate
135,"it's a point-and-shoot camera so you have a small zoom control and a switch between still and video, but after that it's point-and-shoot, very simple exposure and focus are automatic"
135,can I ask what sort of photographs you take?
135,I need a camera that's easy to use but look at look attractive and reasonably priced
135,"this is probably the best camera in the shop that meets everything you need, we have some other excellent cameras, the price goes up a lot, and your choices for color and style get much smaller"
135,thank you for your information
135,"thank you for your time, have a good afternoon"
136,good afternoon how can I help?
136,can you tell me more about this camera
136,"yes it does so many things, this is one of our simplest to use high end cameras, it does a fantastic job in low-light, it does a great job with movement"
136,sounds good how high does the iso go
136,"the ISO goes up to 3200, you can work in very low light conditions that will be very little noise, you can actually produce a very clear picture in the evening"
136,what is exposure
136,it will give you a long exposure up to 30 seconds
136,does it have any preset mode
136,"it has 9 preset modes that let you take pictures according to the light at the location, it's very easy to use"
136,"it's only $550, the best value cameras at that price"
136,why is camera sounds great how much does it cost
136,I see that's a little steep how do you have anything in this range that's more affordable
136,can I ask what sort of pictures you take?
136,I want a camera that's that has good performance but is practical to use
136,"hm a little tricky for the good performance and the practicality, this is already the perfect camera, we can go to something cheaper but they will be some sacrificing creativity"
136,I can show you the cheaper camera and we can talk about it
136,that will give you some idea of how different cameras are placed in the market
136,hm
136,do you like to pick this camera up see how it feels?
136,that is nice
136,"one of the reasons it's so light is it has a plastic lens, the other camera has a glass lens so it's designed to be much lighter and easier to use for things like family portraits"
136,wow and how much is this one
136,68 dollars
136,oh I see okay thank you for your help
136,"always a pleasure, look forward to seeing next time, have a good afternoon"
138,good afternoon how can I help you today?
138,hi is this camera good for low light pictures
138,"this is a fantastic camera for low light pictures, it has an ISO that goes up to 3200 and it's mirrorless, so often you can have a problem when the mirror shakes the camera"
138,this is designed to stop that problem
138,oh how about the sensor size
138,"this is an aps-c sensor so it's a little bit cramped compared to the way some people think of a 35 millimeter sensor, but it's getting very technical for a digital camera, it's quite big"
138,I see actually I'm looking for something a little bit more advanced than this one do you have anything like that
138,we have the top-end Canon 5d Mark 3 so here it gives you full creative control with full manual settings
138,oh that sounds great can you tell me more about it
138,"true, it's the kind of camera that goes to the moon, NASA has designed lenses that would go with this camera, it gives you fantastic low light control"
138,is it heavy
138,"yes it is, it weighs 1 kilogram and when you add a lens it's even heavier"
138,I see
138,"it's designed for full creative control using full glass lenses, it is the top end for anything you ever want to shoot"
138,how much does it cost
138,for this body 2000 dollars
138,sounds like a price for the features
138,can I ask what sort of photographs you take?
138,I like taking pictures of the night sky so I need something that perform well under low light
138,"yes, you will always be working with one of these larger heavier cameras because you need the bulb setting that will let you expose for 10 minutes, 20 minutes, an hour"
138,that sounds good thank you for your information
138,"thank you for your time, please come again"
139,good afternoon how can I help you?
139,afternoon I'm interested with this camera can you tell me more about it
139,"it's a full manual control camera, it gives you total control over the creative process"
139,sounds good what about the manual settings
139,"every manual setting you want is in this camera, this is designed to be the complete camera, it's number one, there are some other similar cameras out there that have similar price and features"
139,how high can I set the ISO
139,"the ISO goes up to 6400, it's excellent for fast shooting in low light"
139,what about the exposure how long can I set it to
139,"as long as you like, it has a bulb setting, so if you want to shoot at a low ISO for 2 hours, this camera can do that"
139,how many autofocus points does it have
139,it has 61 auto focus points that can be combined in a variety of autofocus modes
139,how many colors does it come in
139,"black, black only"
139,well black is a good color and how much does it cost
139,"the body is $2000, the lens is extra"
139,do you have something that's more affordable but in this range of model
139,"we have a camera that takes excellent pictures and equal to this camera, much cheaper, there are some compromises"
139,the Sony Alpha a6000 will offer you 30 seconds shutter speed but it will not give you a bulb modeso if you want to take one hour long photos you don't have that option here
139,and for this model how many auto focus points does it have
139,"it actually has 179 autofocus points, so you get a very fine texture in whatever autofocus mode you use"
139,that's cool and what about the iso setting
139,"the ISO setting is only half of the other camera, 3200"
139,"so it's excellent in the evening shooting, but as it gets darker, some noise may come in"
139,I see well thank you for your time
139,thank you have a good afternoon
140,good afternoon how can I help you today?
140,hi I'm looking for a camera that's practical to use and lightweight
140,"we have two such models, can I ask what sort of photos you take?"
140,um I'm not really good at taking photos or anything I just need something that's easy to use
140,"this camera right here is perfect, it takes beautiful pictures that can be enlarged up to a very big size"
140,does it come in other colors
140,yes right now in stock we have purple pink black silver and red
140,what about the megapixel how many how good can it shoot
140,it has 20 megapixels so you can make quite a large poster and it will still look very clear
140,can you take good pictures because I'm not so good at taking it I'm worried about the quality of the result
140,"it takes great pictures, everything is fully automatic, if you want to you can choose some mode that will help with the color or help it look a little better in different situations"
140,it sounds great how much does it cost
140,it's only $68
140,"this is one of the best cameras in this range at this price point, perhaps you would like to see the other cameras"
140,is there anything else I should know about this model
140,"it has a zoom lens as well, so if you want that little bit of extra help to make the frame look a little tidier it can do that"
140,that sounds pretty good like a really good camera
140,"it's great and it's very easy to use, can I show you the red, it's a very attractive shade of cherry"
140,that sounds good
140,"here it is over here, it's very nice shade"
140,thanks for your time
140,"thank you, look forward to seeing you again"
141,good afternoon how can I help?
141,hi this camera looks good
141,it's an excellent camera that gives you a lot of the features the professional cameras have at a much lower price
141,really can you tell me more
141,"there are so many things that it becomes very personal for me, one of the exciting things is it's a mirrorless camera"
141,that means if you want to take a shoot late at night you won't get that vibration that can happen when a mirror moves inside the camera
141,so you mean it takes good picture at night
141,at night there are cameras that take better pictures but they are much more expensive
141,so how high does the iso go
141,"on this camera, 3200"
141,what about the exposure
141,that can go up to 30 seconds
141,I see
141,would you like a longer exposure camera?
141,if you have a model like that I'd like to see that
141,"please over here, we have the Canon 5d Mark 3"
141,what about this one with the ISO
141,"the ISO here is 6400, it takes excellent shots in the evening but then you have full creative control with manual shutter settings"
141,oh that sounds good how long does the exposure go
141,how long do you need that depends on the photographs you take
141,it looks heavy though how much does it weight
141,"yes it is heavy, it weighs one kilogram without a lens"
141,how much does it cost
141,for the body only $2000
141,Oh I see
141,guess that's why we have the other range of cameras for people who want to take the same grade shots but can accept some compromise in the higher-end features
141,thank you for your time
141,"thank you, have a good afternoon"
142,good afternoon how can I help today?
142,hey I'm looking for camera that's easy to use
142,"we have two great cameras and they are both are easy to use, this one is $68, that one is $550"
142,can you tell me more about this one
142,this is perhaps the simplest camera for people who want to take family photos and some travel shots like landscapes when they're out on tour
142,the sensor has 20 megapixels so you can make quite large posters from it and they look fantastic
142,is it equipped with any preset modes
142,it does have a set of presets sometimes they may seem a little tricky to use but once you choose your 2 or 3 favorites it's very simple
142,does it come in any other colors
142,purple pink black silver and red
142,and is it heavy
142,"this camera is very light, it's only 120 grams, for instance the other more expensive camera over there is 470 grams"
142,sounds like a pretty good option
142,"perhaps you would like to speak with our sale staff over here and they will be able to step you through all the different colors, What's in stock right now, and show you some of the features in practice"
142,thank you
142,thank you for your time
143,good afternoon how can I help today?
143,I'm looking for a camera
143,"we have a lot of different cameras, what sort of pictures do you take?"
143,this one looks good can you tell me about this one
143,"this is a top end camera, it weighs around one kilogram, it has full creative control, many different manual settings, in fact every manual setting that can be on a camera is on this camera"
143,oh I'm not so good with manual settings in cameras maybe can you tell me other models that's more easy to use
143,"yes of course, we have a perfect model over  here"
143,this camera is one quarter the price of the other camera but the photographs are just as good
143,really tell me more
143,"it's much simpler with a different range of automatic settings, fewer manual options"
143,and does it take good pictures in dark environment
143,there are some limits in dark environments simple work very well up to the late evening
143,what about the sensor size
143,"this is a cropped digital sensor so it's quite large for digital camera but to keep the price down, it's not too big"
143,I see so I can take good picture with these even though I don't have very extensive knowledge about photography
143,"the picture quality from this camera is excellent option, for most photos it is as good as the top-end camera"
143,can I have that in other colors
143,it's available in white silver and black
143,would you like to try a few shots with it?
143,let me see
143,the result does look good
143,with this lever you can make the picture bigger to see if the result has totally detailed that you need
143,"our counter staff over here can show you the model and step you through some of the instructions, if you would like to have a talk with them"
143,that's great
143,thank you please come this way
144,good afternoon how can I help you today?
144,I'm looking for a camera
144,"we have many cameras, what kind of pictures do you take may I ask?"
144,I'm not really into photography I just needed for a family vacation that's coming up
144,with this vacation are you travelling much through different landscapes or City holiday?
144,mostly pictures of my family
144,"this camera is perfect, it comes in a range of colors, it takes fantastic pictures, it's really easy to use so you can focus on the photograph instead of all the ways that the camera can be set"
144,how powerful is it
144,"it takes pictures that are 20 megapixels big, that will blow up to be quite a large poster on your wall and the picture will be really clean"
144,oh yeah that sounds good doesn't have any preset modes
144,"it's got 18 preset modes you will probably find 2 or 3 work best for you, and then you can relax with those and not think too much about the others"
144,"it also allows a certain amount of retouching so if something goes a little bit wrong like the background is too bright, you can fix that in the camera"
144,that sounds good is it light because I don't want to be carrying around heavy stuff all through the vacation
144,please feel how heavy it is
144,it's pretty light
144,would you like to take some pictures with it now?
144,it's pretty easy
144,and the pictures look great
144,true thank you very much for your help
144,thank you for your time have a good afternoon
145,good afternoon how can I help?
145,this camera looks good can you tell me more about it
145,"it's an excellent camera, yes it's designed to take the kind of pictures that a top end camera can take with a few compromises to bring it down to an affordable price point"
145,how good is the quality when I take pictures at night for example
145,"this is an excellent camera in the evening time, it can go up to 3200 ISO and have a 30 second shutter speed"
145,can you do long exposure shoot
145,"not pass 30 seconds, I'm sorry for that you would have to go to the top-end camera with different settings"
145,can you show me that one
145,certainly
145,"this is the Canon 5d Mark 3, and it has all the manual settings you could ever want full creative control"
145,and the exposure is
145,only limited by your imagination
145,sounds great
145,it has a bulb setting so that if you want to take a 2 hour or 20 hour exposure even that is possible
145,I see what else can it do
145,"everything if you want to do something with a camera, this camera can do it"
145,how much does it cost
145,"you can see we only have the body on display, the body only is $2000"
145,that's quite expensive
145,yes and then the lenses can cost just as much or even more
145,I guess it's a pretty good camera then
145,it's the choice of most professional
145,thank you for your time
145,thank you have a good afternoon
146,good afternoon how can I help?
146,I'm looking for a point and shoot camera
146,"this cameras is at a different point, it takes fantastic photos but there's a lot of complexities in how it's used"
146,please come have a look at this camera over here
146,"this is an excellent quality point and shoot camera, it can shoot 20 megapixel pictures so you can blow them up as big posters on your wall and they still look great"
146,does it have any preset modes
146,it has 18 preset modes but what we find with most users is they choose two or three favorites
146,can I do any retouching with the camera
146,"there a few retouching modes to clean up some skin colors especially if they look a little bit washed out in sunlight or under fluorescent lights, there are 12 of these modes"
146,what about the optical zoom
146,it has a basic 5 x optical zoom so if you want to set up your family photo you can adjust the frame very easily
146,perhaps you'd like to take couple pictures with it
146,that looks good
146,"it comes in a number of colors too, we have purple pink black silver and red"
146,what does it cost
146,"one of the best cameras at the price, it's only $68"

150,does it have any preset modes for different environment conditions

150,"this is the Nikon Coolpix S 2800, it's lightweight, convenient, responsive with excellent picture quality"
150,how many megapixels
150,20 megapixels so you can make quite large enlargement
150,and this this one come in white
150,"white is almost the only color it does not come in, it comes in purple pink black silver and red"
150,I see and how much does this one cost

151,I am looking for camera
151,can I ask what sort of pictures you take?
151,show me the camera that's that's practical but also has a little bit of manual configuration so that I can set up my pictures
151,this camera here is excellent but it has no manual control at all
151,"if we look over here, this camera is practical for family portraits, it takes excellent travel pictures and has good manual control"
151,what sort of control can I do with it
151,"you have control over the exposure, the shutter speed, the iso and of course all the framing and the autofocus. it has full manual control"
151,I see how high can the iso be
151,"the iso goes up to 3200, it's very good up to mid evening, beyond that you will need a flash"
151,and what about the exposure
151,"the shutter speed can be set up to 30 seconds, if you want to go faster than that it is not possible with this camera"
151,how much does it cost
151,it's only 550 dollars but it has 179 autofocus points you can hold autofocus across a wide range of movement and has a good sensor size

151,is it heavy though
151,"please pick it up and see, 470 grams"
151,it seems like a good camera
151,"it is a little bit heavier than most point and shoots, but a full professional camera can weigh two or three or even five kilograms"
151,I see thanks for your help
151,thank you for your time have a good afternoon

152,"this picture quality is the best, it's the choice of NASA, it's choice of portraits around the world, you'll find this in every top professionals camera kit"
152,does it take good pictures at night
152,yes some people use this to take pictures of the stars and create star trails
152,that's perfect how high can I set the ISO
152,for normal shooting the ISO is set to 6400 you can also bring it down to about 80 iso as well
152,and what about the exposure
152,"on a standard shutter speed exposure goes up to 30 seconds, for longer than that you would need a timer and to go to bulb mode and then the exposure is indefinite"
152,"you can see we are selling the body only, we have a full range of lenses that would match this camera very well"
152,how much does the body weight
152,almost one kilogram and the lens would double the whole camera weight
152,is weight a problem?
152,no if it can take picture at night then it would be a very good option
152,we do have another camera over here whose picture quality is just as good but it's not so good at nighttime
152,how much does this one cost
152,the camera body is $2000 the lenses are extra

153,show me the features of this camera

153,and it takes family pictures very easily and they look beautiful

154,which one would you recommend
154,can I ask what sort of pictures you take?
154,I take pictures of nothing in particular just when I'm somewhere and
154,I understand I travel a lot myself and I never know what I'm going to see so I try to have a camera that will respond to what I see when I see it
154,"this camera has full manual control but you can set it so it works almost like a point and shoot, very easy to use"
154,does it have any preset modes
154,it has 9 basic preset modes that deal with different situations like beach or snow or night portrait
154,what about the price
154,it's $550 and it takes the same top quality pictures as camera costing four time as more that makes it ideal for travel especially when you go to interesting new places
154,is it heavy
154,please pick it up and see
154,it's a bit heavy
154,this is about 500 grams we have a much lighter camera over here
154,"this is the Nikon Coolpix, please pick it up and take a couple pictures"
154,it seems very practical
154,"it's very lightweight, it has excellent picture quality, the sensor is 20 megapixels, it's basically a point and shoot camera"
154,does it come in other color option
154,we have purple pink black silver and red

154,okay thanks
154,thank you for your time have a good afternoon
155,good afternoon how can I help you?
155,I'm looking for a camera for taking pictures in concerts
155,"tricky, will you be using flash?"
155,I prefer not
155,I understand so you would also need to be up to have very close control over exposure?
155,yeah that's true
155,there's really only one kind of camera that will work for you
155,"this is the Canon 5d Mark 3, it gives you full creative control so that gives you full exposure control"
155,in concert you might have big hot spots of light when you actually need quite a fast shutter speed or it could be very dim or  you need a high ISO
155,yeah does this do well on that environment
155,"this is the best camera on the market for that environment, the choice of top professionals for concert shooting"
155,"you have 61 autofocus points, some cameras have more but this has more modes for how it talks about those points and how it thinks about them"
155,the ISO option is
155,6400 ISO which is excellent
155,but then sometimes your lens will have different settings that might affect that
155,I see
155,we do have one set up over here in a concert style arrangement if you would like to try taking some shots
155,that would be nice
155,please step over here to our showroom
155,and one of our assistants will come through and work through the camera with you and show you how to setup
155,thank you for your help
155,thank you have a good afternoon
156,good afternoon how can I help today?
156,do you have a camera with the full creative control
156,"yes we do, we have the Canon 5d Mark 3 you may have heard about it"
156,yeah I wanted to see that
156,"here it is, we are very excited about it, I've taken it out twice myself now and take in some nature pictures with running water"
156,is the quality good
156,the quality is the best this is how  the cameras are judged
156,tell me more about it
156,you probably already understand about some of the inland stabilisation
156,sure
156,but what's new in this model is the way the autofocus modes can use fewer autofocus points to pick up more finely grained texture movement
156,it can follow an object moving in any direction through your frame and keep them crisp and focus
156,sounds good
156,it's the same technology they use in the modern gaming station
156,what about the exposure and ISO
156,a lot of people using this for high-end astrophotography
156,for that most people use a bulb setting with an indefinite exposure time
156,the standard shutter speed is 30 seconds and the iso goes up to 6400
156,that sounds pretty nice how much does it cost
156,this particular body is $2000
156,would you like to pick it up and see how it feels in your hand
156,it's a very solid camera
156,yes it's one of the most solid on the market

233,okay show me
233,"the quality from this camera is on a par with the other camera over there, but it's a quarter of the price and you don't have to buy lenses in addition everything's included in the body you can take up to 30 seconds shutter speed photos"
233,I see and how many autofocus points does it have
233,it has a 179 autofocus points it can capture movement brilliantly any movement effect you want to create is very easy with this camera
233,is it very heavy
233,please pick it up in about half a kilogram
233,there is a fair bulk to it
233,"yes the better the camera the heavier the camera, so you will find a body over here weighs 1 kg before you even add lenses"
233,I see kinda makes sense ah ok thanks for help
233,have a good afternoon
234,good afternoon how can I help?
234,I'm looking for a camera for work I broke the old one it's an insurance job
234,what sort of work do you do?
234,a freelance photographer for magazines and newspapers
234,were you working with Nikon or Canon cameras?
234,recently I've been using a Canon camera
234,"then I think you already know the Canon 5d mark 3, this is the body only $2000"
234,so this is the new one
234,this is the Mark 3 with full frame sensor
234,I see how does the auto focus points can pass the Mark 2
234,"There are fewer autofocus points but that makes it more responsive, there is different software working to integrate them so less processing, more accurate results"
234,okay that's great to know so two thousand dollars how much do the lenses go for
234,do you still have your old lenses from the previous camera in good condition?
234,yes I still get a couple of them as I said this is an insurance claim so
234,I understand we have a brochure here with a range of lenses and suggested prices but we can negotiate a package when you have a look through and see what you would like to put together
234,that sounds great I'll take one of them with me
234,thanks a lot for your time look forward to seeing you again

236,that's great do I have to worry about setting things manually

238,okay you told me about one
238,"over here we have some simple family cameras, point and shoot that still took  beautiful pictures"
238,is it fairly child proof or is it solid enough it feels very light
238,"it's very solid but it is only 120 grams, it's designed for all the family to use safely, would you like to take a picture with it?"
238,oh yeah okay let's give it a go

239,"it is fun ,it has 13 artistic effect modes such as toy camera, black and white, different illusion effect"
239,okay and how is it for long exposures
239,"the standard shutter speeds run up to 30 seconds, I'm sorry it has no bulb mode so 30 seconds is your limit"
239,okay I say yeah
239,yeah and how much is this camera
239,"this is 550 dollars, it takes pictures as good as a camera costing 4 times as much"
239,sounds impressive
239,but with some compromises as I said 30 seconds is the longest exposure you can take
239,ok thanks for your help I will have a look around I will think about

239,bye

240,"yes this is the right camera for your needs, this corner is all about point and shoot cameras that are very easy to use and print to quite a large size"

241,"this is an excellent camera, it's very easy to use and it takes pictures that are as good as a tough and professional camera"
241,alright so I see
241,it can feel quite heavy we have another lighter kind of camera that's good for family events over here if you'd like to come and have a look
241,alright
241,"the Nikon Coolpix is only 120 grams, feel the weight, any member of the family can use it, it's basically point and shoot and has beautiful picture quality"
241,okay I see that's good
241,"the camera can take pictures for reproduction magazines prints and so forth, this camera is designed for the family home with beautiful enlargements"
241,that sounds more like it
241,"yes it has a 20 megapixel sensor so any local print shop can have a look at your photo, you can even crop down so that you can reframe your picture and still get a nice result"
241,I sort of understand ok right ok
241,"it has a very simple optical zoom that you can use as well, just get the picture frame to perfectly, very easy to use very responsive and fast so you don't have to get caught up in the complexities of the camera"
241,that's a definite bonus huh oh thanks for your help I will have a think
241,"anytime come in have a chat we can give me more information about the camera, thanks for your time"
241,thank you
242,good afternoon how can I help?
242,I'm looking for a camera for my business
242,what sort of pictures will you need to take?
242,wedding photos mainly I'm hoping
242,what kind of cameras if you used before?
242,I've had some Old Reliable solid cameras in the past looking for update a bit really
242,"things that move very quickly, there are some big changes, this is a very popular wedding photography camera"
242,ok tell me tell me about the features on there
242,the sensor in this is the same size as the old 35 mil frame that you might remember from shooting film at weddings
242,yeah
242,"so the quality is very high, it's perfect for reproduction to every format even NASA use it for astrophotography"
242,all sounds a bit extreme I have no idea
242,it's a camera designed to do anything you want to do
242,so I guess you gotta pay for it
242,this body is $2000 lens are separate
242,I see
242,"we have another camera over here that will take excellent photographs, the quality is almost as good as that camera and there are some great settings"
242,so the main differences is
242,"there are limits on how far you can go with the shutter, it will only go up to 30 seconds, there is no bulb mode so depending on the effect you want that is the limit in wedding photography"
242,alright yeah I get that but the price
242,the full camera is one-quarter of the price of the other cameras body
242,right that's a big difference isn't it
242,you might like to pick it up and try taking a few shots
242,okay thanks I'll have a play with the pair of them and I'll get back to you
242,"okay I'll just be over here if you have any questions, I'm happy to help we can set one up if you want to play for a little longer in one corner"
242,okay thank you
242,ok thanks for your help
242,thanks for you time come in and have a chat anytime
243,good afternoon how can I help?
243,yeah I'm looking for a camera maybe more for use at night
243,"we have two cameras that have pretty good in low light, one camera can do anything you want, andthe other camera has some limits"
243,show me what you got
243,"this is the Canon 5d Mark 3, it's top of the range you can use it for astrophotography in Star Trails because it has a bulb mode you can take some very long exposures"
243,I said yeah that could be used for
243,would you like to see the other kind of camera?
243,uh sure
243,this camera can take pictures in general that match the other camera for quality but it's a quarter the price for the full camera compared to the other camera without a lens
243,okay that sounds good
243,the top shutter speed is only 30 seconds the ISO is only 3200 so there are some limits on what you can do it night time for photography
243,I see but yeah okay
243,can I ask what sort of pictures you like to take?
243,I'm trying to take pictures of the night sky and things like that
243,are you trying to shoot night for day for example to make the night-time look like daytime?
243,uh no not particularly just to get the experience of the night really
243,This camera should achieve most of what you're looking for
243,ok that sounds great I will just have a look by myself if you don't mind and
243,no problem if you have any other questions I'll just be over here please feel free to ask
243,thank you
243,okay thanks for your help

357,"this particular Canon is the latest 5d Mark 3 it has a full frame sensor so you can get fantastic quality out of it, It's the kind used by top end photographers"
357,so you mean if it's good in all conditions
357,"all conditions, this is a camera that can go to space or to the Antarctic"
357,ok good I take this one

358,how can I help?
358,you know I was looking for for this camera and I was I want a very cheap one I want to know like this is a good price and is it good for every condition or not
358,"this is a great general use cameras, it's quite cheap, it's very light, it's good for family snaps and basic holiday photos"
358,what about you know when we compare with Canon or maybe Sony which one is the cheapest one you know I'm on low budget
358,"this is definitely the cheapest camera, the Canon over here it's top end professional camera so it's $2000 without a lens"
358,I see but I think the cheapest one is better
358,"yes it's 68 dollars, it's an excellent choice, can I ask what sort of pictures you take?"
358,you know I take only like a portrait  like you know humans and major things yeah only those two
358,so you don't have any special artistic things you want to do in low light anything like that?
358,no I wanted simple I'm not expert uh sorry
358,this camera is perfect for what you want
358,okay I take this one
358,okay if you'd like to step over here we can show you how it works and work through the operation with you
359,hello how you doing
359,"Oh very well, yourself how can I help today?"
359,yeah you know I want this kind of camera you know I wanted to be very light and also I think the design is good so I just want to ask is this the cheapest one in this shop
359,Yes it's only $68 other cameras range up to $2000 without a lens
359,what about the Canon is it cheaper than this one
359,no that's the camera that's $2000 without a lens so the price doubles
359,I would like to ask about is it easy to do I need to set up any manuals for this camera
359,"it has some manual settings that you can approach through the menus, but really once you have it set the way you like it you can leave it just there and point and shoot"
359,would you like to take a picture with it?
359,maybe not you know I was just talking about it now anyway thanks so much I'll see you have good afternoon
359,no worries thanks for your time have a good afternoon
360,sorry I may ask something about this camera
360,yes of course how can I help you?
360,I want a camera that provide me a better image quality you know the one I got is very low so I want you know the one that has a very long range of iso and also have a very good long exposure and could you give me more detail about this camera
360,"we actually have two cameras that would suit the kind of pictures you want to take, this camera is $550 and the Canon over here it's $2000 without a lens"
360,so you mean the 2000 one is better in terms of quality
360,"let's come over and take a look this camera, it has every manual setting you could ever need, it weighs a kilogram about that's because it has a massive amount of circuitry, menu options, and so forth for full creative control"
360,what about the weight is like lighter than any others
360,the sony you looked at before is half the weight
360,what about the sensor size of this camera you know like I think better sensor size is like better quality
360,yes this camera has a full 35 millimeter equivalent size senor
360,okay just last question are there just one color or are there many colors
360,this is a tough and professional camera so it only comes in Black
360,okay thank you so much for you know uh your detailed explanation I will think about it see you
360,thanks for your time have a good afternoon
361,good afternoon how can I help?
361,you know I just want one camera that's very easy to use and I wanted to work in any condition since you know I will go for traveling in two weeks so I was looking for one that's very cheap could you suggest me
361,can I ask what sort of pictures you take?
361,you know typical in general and I don't have any idea I'm not expert so basically that I go traveling so maybe landscape maybe
361,"this is an excellent camera that takes high quality pictures, almost as good as a top-end professional camera, very easy to use but it's also $550, we have easy cameras that look cheap"
361,great so could you suggest to me like the cheapest one
361,come over here let's have a look at the nikon
361,"this is only $68 and it still takes great pictures, would you like to try?"
361,yes I want to try it
361,come in color
361,this camera is quite stylish it comes in purple pink black silver and red
361,and is very easy to use like just press this button and then everything's beautiful
361,"if you want some extra creative control it's got some artistic presets and some manual settings, but really, if you just use the two or three things you work with, the most easiest, then you just stay there and it's point and shoot"
361,you know what thanks so much for your information and I'll come again thanks thank you
361,thanks for your time have a good weekend
362,hello may I ask you something about camera
362,sure how can I help?
362,okay you know I am going go for like you know forest because my my work is like a photographer I want to capture the animal it's run very fast so I was looking for a camera that have very fast shutter speeds could you suggest me with that
362,"just checking you are a professional camera, you've used top end cameras?"
362,yes I use top end camera all the time
362,"this is the brand new Canon 5d mark 3, if you already have some Canon lenses that will work on this camera, the shutter speed will go quite quick, it will go up 2000th of a second"
362,so this is the camera you have that has the fastest shutter speed in your shop
362,yes it's actually one of the fastest that is generally available
362,uh what about the image quality of course I know that it it's fast but what about the sensor size the exposure
362,"this is the equivalent of a full size 35 mil frame sensor, so it's the large standard version of the sensor, now the image quality is fantastic, it is a top end camera meant for publication"
362,How about the ISO range of this camera
362,the ISO here goes up to 6400 and with the sensory it uses there is very little noise at that rating
362,this camera is very good huh yeah you know maybe I just want to look another one more and compare a little bit and I'll think about it later
362,please have a look around and if you want to come and have a chat again
362,thank you for your great service
362,"thank you for your time, bye"
363,hi how can I help
363,hello thanks so much I am looking for a camera where it has a nice you know ISO mode because I usually go out at night with my friend so you know the ISO is very important so I want one with high ISO
363,"this is an excellent camera, it takes top quality photographs, the iso go up to 3200 so fairly good in general city low light conditions"
363,is it possible for me to do try this
363,please take a few pictures
363,this seems to be a very nice camera
363,"yeah the pictures it takes it just as good as a top end camera but it's built down to a different price point, it's only $550"
363,"it's fantastic with the way it works with autofocus even with low lights it can capture movement quite well and keep things in Focus regardless of where they going, even in the depth of the photograph as well as across the lens"
363,Yeah you know I know about that that that you know some camera has very quick capturing mode yeah I talk talking about that I want to know that how how well how about the you know what about the shutter speed of this camera is it fast is it like you know because at lot at night if you have low light so I need fast and also I have high high ISO mode
363,the shutter speed goes up to 1000th of asecond but it can go as low as 30 seconds so you got some creative control and different effects
363,one other thing  I used to adjust a lot of parameters like white balance and also the artistic modes I want like different kind of things what about this camera do they have it or how many modes do they have
363,"this has full manual control, most of that  access through the menu but that's the same for top end cameras as well, things like the white balance and so forth, a little bit involved with this camera but it's easy enough to do and it can accept your settings"
363,really I see what about the price
363,"this is only $550, to get a full professional camera which would be the nearest you would come for competing with picture quality you'd be four or five times that price"
363,I see you know what like today I just want to look around so thanks so much for your detailed explanation I will come back again because I'm not just going to buy it today so later to talk but thanks so much for your time now
363,anytime come back anytime we can talk about some more things to do with the camera and maybe take it out and give a bit of a go
364,hello
364,how can I help?
364,you know what I was looking for a camera where I could have you know I take a picture of fireworks and it needs very long exposure in order to keep everything like aligned you know when you take a picture of a firework you wanted to see it beautiful could you please give me the details camera with you have you know the one that has long exposure
364,"could I ask how you use the photograph of the fireworks, are they meant for print publication or are they for your interest?"
364,I use for publication I work for a publisher
364,"we have two cameras that will do the job you need, but if this is for print we have a full frame camera that you will probably want to have a look at, let's go check the Canon 5d Mark 3"
364,okay
364,"this has full manual settings anything you want to do with a camera you can do with this camera, so you have a standard shutter speed up to 30 seconds but then you can go into bulb mode and the shutter can be open forever, it's an infinite range"
364,well it's really good it's really match with what I want
364,"it's designed with the print media in mind as well, the photographs from here come out ready for publication with very little editing needed"
364,so I guess is a little expensive right
364,"it's an top end professional camera, this camera body is $2000 but then you would have to buy lenses as well"
364,I see I have lens so maybe this one is fine for me what I want to ask more about the autofocus point because I wanted to make sure that all the screen are capture perfectly  and you know I don't want my pictures to be blur you know what I mean
364,"this Canon 5d Mark 3 only has 61 autofocus points, it sounds like a lot but many older cameras have up to 200 points, what Canon have done, have integrated some AI kind of aspects in software for interpreting that, so this one of the best cameras for working with different autofocus points across the sensor"
364,I see this one seemed to match with what I want last thing is about the iso because I have to capture it at night what about the ISO because I have to take pictures at night
364,"the ISO goes up 6400 so you can do quite a lot in low light conditions, and then depending on what you want to do with shutter speeds, as we were saying earlier, there is a lot of artistic possibilities"
364,alright so so in terms of professional this one is the best in your shop
364,this is the number one camera for quality and for controllability
364,alright thanks so much you know maybe I will think a little bit about it and maybe I'll come back later
364,thanks for your time come back anytime and you have a good afternoon
365,sorry may I ask you something
365,how can I help?
365,you know I want a good camera can you suggest me
365,can I ask what sort of pictures you take?
365,well anything basically um I just one a good one that work in every condition
365,"are you using your photographs for print publication, for personal interest, for sharing with friends?"
365,you know sometimes I just post on Facebook uh but sometimes I want to print it out so if you could suggest  one that's good everything that's great
365,"this Canon is a top end professional camera, it might be a little bit more than you need but over here we have an excellent camera that takes fantastic shots almost as good as this and is more flexible to use"
365,okay
365,"this is the Sony a6000 and you have full manual control and an excellent quality sensor, great AutoFocus Features and you can take fantastic photographs for enlargement, but it's also designed around the idea that you are going to uses these photos that you're going to put them in Facebook, share them with friends, do some prints and maybe post up to Flickr as well"
365,nice so maybe this is what I want may I ask about price
365,this is 550 dollars compared to the top end camera we started at two to three thousand dollars without a lens
365,oh I see so the price totally different
365,"yes this camera is designed for the kind of photography you do, whereas the other camera is designed for full creative control in absolutely anything and every environment whether it's space, snow, or sea"
365,I got it you know what I still interested in the previous one it seem to be nice just wanted to look around the shop okay just want to compare
365,"that's great if you have any other questions I'll just be over here, happy to help"
366,what is the top model you have
366,hi how's it going?
366,"we have the brand new Canon 5d Mark 3 over here, can I ask what sort of camera you used in the past?"
366,I also use Canon previous Model I think
366,so you already have a full set of lenses that will be compatible with this camera?
366,yeah actually I have lens so maybe yeah I could use it with this definitely right
366,absolutely yes
366,"there are some big differences between this and the last Model, this only has 61 autofocus points, they've change the way the brain works, it's a lot smarter now"
366,what about the you know the iso is it like wide range or is it like a very narrow
366,"it covers around about 50 ISO up to 6400 so for the top quality shots on a tripod, it's got fantastic results and really great in low light"
366,uh andwhat about the exposure
366,the shutter speed in a standard way opens up to 30 seconds but then it has a bulb setting so that you can keep the shutter open indefinitely
366,do they have only one color you know still previous one I also got the black one so I want some different colors of my new camera
366,"it's a top end professional camera, it comes in Black"
366,yeah that should be and what about the weight you know previous one is so big you know sometimes when I go out when I take out I need something lighter
366,"if you need the creative control of this camera, it's there maybe two other brands that compete, but all of them weigh around about 1 kilogram without a lens, so the lens will double the weight"
366,I see
366,"we have a camera over here that takes pictures that are almost as good with a lot of manual control, it is much cheaper and lighter"
366,maybe not you know I want  the best one full frame camera is my main concern so maybe this is the right one
366,do you have another full frame in this shop
366,we only have the canon in stock at the moment I'm sorry
366,I see you know what maybe I come back again and take a look around so thanks so much for your kindness and yeah I'll come back
366,have a good afternoon
367,how can I help?
367,hi how you doing you know I was looking for a camera has a very good sensor size
367,"this is a good one, we have a better one, can I ask have you use pictures you take today going to print publication or do they go online?"
367,"actually just go online, I have a professional looking for something this time I am also looking for something good quality"
367,"yes of course, this takes great pictures, but the next step up is a full professional camera is over here is the Canon"
367,before going to that I just want to know more about this is it what about the manual setting it has many setting is it possible for me to set many modes you know many more like landscape or portrait or different white balance
367,"it has full manual settings but it also has a range of preset modes so you can ask camera automatically to set itself for the kind of picture you want to take, or you can choose your settings and then put them yourself"
367,I see so so this one has also have many function even though the one you are going to show me might be better but this one also has so many settings that I could set
367,this cameras designed to take top end style professional photographs but at a price so you're giving up some flexibility for that
367,can I try
367,sure
367,well you know what it seems not best fit for I need that that let's see the one you wanna show me
367,"over here we have the Canon 5d Mark 3, it is a full frame sensor is a top-end professional camera with full manual settings"
367,oh nice so this is the latest model
367,"this is the latest model, so in some ways if you look at the specifications like it only has 61 autofocus points, but that means that it can work much more quickly, much more responsive to the shutter when you want to take a picture the way it thinks is being fine tuned and refined"
367,what about the autofocus Points so previously I use different camera like Nikon so all the lens I cannot use right
367,"that's right if you have a set of nikon lenses, you may need to go to another Nikon camera body, but can I ask how old those lens are?"
367,actually just for 5 years
367,they would still be compatible with the new Nikon body
367,do you have a Nikon bodies with full frame in this shop
367,I'm sorry we only carry the canon
367,I want to ask more about the canon is it heavy do I have to buy a new lens
367,this camera without lens just weigh a kilogram
367,yeah that's why it's a top cost camera huh
367,"it's very robust, it's absolutely Rock Solid, all the componentry are top quality it's almost impossible to break the body on this"
367,so so for professional you saying this is your best value of recommendation
367,this is designed to be a top end professional cameras
367,alright thanks so much for your detail and I want to go out a bit and maybe I'll just have to go now so thanks so much have a good afternoon I'll see you
367,take your time have a good afternoon I see you
368,hello good afternoon how can I help you?
368,hello
368,yeah you know I was I want to know I was looking for a camera that I don't mind about picture quality just beautiful just looks nice I want to bring it to a conference so I want to look nice do you have any camera with a good body by Design
368,"just checking you'd like to take a few pictures of the conference you're going to, so that will be people, it would be PowerPoint slides?"
368,that's right
368,"this camera right here the Nikon is perfect, it becomes in a range of colors purple pink black silver and red, it's incredibly light under 120 grams and fits in your pocket, and it's only $68"
368,yeah maybe the purple one would be nice for me but what about the setting
368,"it has some artistic presets where the camera makes different decisions for you, but you don't have to touch any of those, it can be used straight out point and shoot camera"
368,so basically just point and shoot and everything will be beautiful
368,"yes it's very clever that way, it's got great picture quality as well"
368,last question to ask about the price is it expensive
368,68 dollars
368,that's good price
368,this is the cheapest one you got or or you have like cheaper model comparing to this
368,"this is the cheapest full camera we actually have, if you want to go to something else or those cheap cameras these days it's been replaced by mobile phone cameras"
368,what about that preset mode can you explain more about that
368,"yes if you are in particular conditions, like a conference, or beach, or snow, or taking a portrait night time of fireworks, you can do some settings in the menu where the camera knows that's what you're thinking and it can set the ideal settings for you"
368,okay this camera seems to be best match for me you know I want to research more bit about camera so thanks so much for your help so I just wanted to go around and
368,"thanks for your time, if you have any other questions later on come back anytime thank you"
368,thank you thank you
369,hello
369,good afternoon how can I help?
369,no I was looking for a one camera that's not too expensive and I want the one stylish you have any recommendation for for this qualification I give you
369,"if you actually come to the corner of the shop where we have those cameras on display, this is the Nikon and it's only 120 grams, it's very stylish it comes in purple pink black silver, it takes great family pictures or social pictures"
369,what about if I go for traveling like landscape is it okay to take light mountains or beach is a good
369,"it takes any picture you want to take, really all the pictures they come out really well it's got 20 megapixel sensor, it's got a nice sense of color balance, you get rich colors and great travel pics"
369,I see uh nice
369,can I ask if you ever taken any artistic pictures at all?
369,actually no you know I just use it for traveling I'm not that Professional
369,"this is a few artistic presets but you are free to ignore, you can set this up so it's just point and shoot and it's very responsive"
369,so how many modes do you have because I can try to explore try to use it can you explain it to me
369,"we actually have a brochure on this particular camera that will go through the full detail of the specifications, but for now just think that it's got a nice optical zoom lens 5 times, if you really want to  there is some Limited manual settings as well, and probably the most important thing for a lot of people is that weight that it will just live in the pocket and it's ready when you are"
369,you mention about optical zooms what does that mean can you explain to me
369,that's an easy way to make the picture seem closer or further so that you don't have to run backwards and forwards to frame up your photo
369,I said basically like a zoom in and zoom out but that's what you mean
369,yes yes it will go up to 5 times that kind of zoom
369,okay thank you very much you know I was very new here so your explanation and was so nice is very easy to understand anyway I want to look around a bit more and I'll come back later
369,have a great afternoon come back anytime if you have more questions
369,thank you so much
370,good afternoon how can I help?
370,oh yeah you know I was looking for a camera that's easy to use and not so expensive you have any
370,"this is a top end professional camera, it's very complex, very heavy, takes beautiful pictures but it's designed for top end professional"
370,oh really how much is it
370,"just for the body is $2000, but for a simple camera we have a full camera ready to go to take nice pictures for $68"
370,please bring me to that one
370,"over here this is the Nikon, it only weighs 120 grams and it can be set up so it's just point and shoot, it's very responsive, please pick it up"
370,yeah it's very light and easy to use
370,"it's very easy to use, it has some options there if you want to try something different you can, but most people just set it up so it's point and shoot"
370,so you mention about the many modes can you explain like any modes you have in the future I might try it of course I will point and shoot but in the future I try it
370,"it has preset mode so you can tell it whether you are at the beach, or the snow, or taking a portrait of nighttime and it will automatically choose the best settings for your environment and also has some glamour retouch mode so you can make people look a little more exciting so you change the skin tone, put some stars on, give them a different smile, give them a crown, that kind of thing that you see on Facebook"
370,nice did you mention about color just one color and I am wondering is there any color
370,we have this camera in purple pink black silver and red
370,nice I love pink colors how about the weight I know so like you know any other additional things for for this camera like an option one
370,"there a lot of options with this camera, we will give your brochure when you buy that outlines the accessories you can buy, but as it is it works try putting it in your camera in your pocket now, that will give you an idea of just how light it is"
370,Yes actually you know very easy to to carry on yeah it's good fit for my pocket so
370,"it's a very popular choice for families and for people who go out to a lot of parties or conferences, it's a very social camera"
370,yeah maybe this is right for me
370,feel free to take some pictures for them
370,yeah thanks so much but you know maybe I will try later kind of busy today just just look around maybe I come back later
370,no problems come back anytime have a good afternoon thank you YouTube
370,thank you you too
371,hello
371,hello good afternoon how can I help?
371,yeah you know what I want a good camera my previous camera just broke and I need to one with full frame and also the one that you know can be able to take a picture of the waterfall you know I am going to the trip with my friend tomorrow and I need the one that could capture beautiful waterfall do you have any idea of full frame camera that have a high quality image
371,you're used to using a top end professional camera?
371,that's right
371,over here we have the Canon 5d Mark 3 you may have heard about it before. it has a full frame sensor and basically every manual setting you could ask for
371,yeah I have heard about this more oh ah how much was this
371,"the price has actually come down since the last model, it's quite a lot cheaper, this camera body is $2000"
371,yeah it's actually cheaper than the one I got this is interesting only one color
371,it's a top end professional camera that come in Black
371,yeah I see it always come in black what about the iso sometime I use it at night I need wide range of ISO
371,"this ranges from 50 iso up to 6400, I think if you had the old canon it's probably the same specification"
371,what are the focusing point how many to you hve
371,"this has 61 autofocus points, which sounds like a lower number than the old model, but what's happened is they've change the software inside the camera, so if fewer points means it's much more responsive but it is actually slightly more accurate"
371,I see what about another professional camera you have only canon or you have anything else
371,"the canon in general that's what people have been asking us for, the nikon is out there, we are waiting for more specifications on the new model now"
371,I said yeah maybe I come back for can I make on I want to compare it so anyway thanks so much for all your help I will try to come back as soon as possible
371,"no problem have a good afternoon, come back anytime thank you"
371,thank you so much
372,good afternoon how can I help?
372,hello you know I was looking for a camera that's not too heavy but it's also I wanted with a good ISO range because  yeah you know I want I want to take it all around and I also want to take pictures at night so I was very concerned about the iso so in the shop which mode has a good range of ISO which model
372,"we have two cameras with a good ISO range, this one in your hand now goes up to 3200 ISO so you can take pictures without using a Flash and get some good results without too much noise"
372,so this is the one you recommend to me I don't need to take a look at the other two
372,can I ask what sort of pictures you take?
372,it actually just a city at night you know I love to go out tonight like I am I so
372,"there are some limits with this particular camera, the shutter speed goes up to 30 seconds but then that's the limit, if you like I can show you the canon that is much more flexible"
372,yeah why not
372,"over here, this is the new Canon 5d Mark 3 and it has a bulb setting, so even though the standard shutter speed can only go up to 30 seconds, you can go to the bulb setting and keep the shutter open for one hour, two hours, forever, it's up to you, full creative control"
372,yeah but this thing seems to be quite heavy you as I mentioned earlier I want something that's little light so maybe I will go back to that do you have any other model compare to this one what about that one is it also good for me to take picture at night
372,"come and have a look at it, it's a very different kind of camera"
372,"this is a social camera for family snaps, for parties, for going to conventions, for good general family use, very cheap, take great pictures but you don't really have the creative control"
372,what about the megapixel like how how about the pixels the quality of the image that I will get
372,"this has 20 megapixels and can take quite a nice image, but again if you want full manual control at night time it's going to be very limited"
372,I see it's very hard for me to decide last question about this camera what about the zoom what is the range that I can zoom with this  camera
372,"this camera has the one lens inside the camera body, and it's a 5 times optical zoom, would you like to take a picture with it?"
372,yeah actually maybe not but it's still not match with what I want you know what I will come back again I want to see you around and thanks so much for your kind you know
372,"thanks for your time have a good afternoon come back anytime, see you"
372,see you
373,good afternoon how can I help you?
373,yeah good afternoon you know I am a Sports photographers so I used to capture images of you know athletic so people playing soccer and also basketball so I need a good camera where I want like many autofocus point and also has a high shutter speed so you have any recommendations for me
373,"do you take pictures from the sidelines from inside the fence, or do you have a press pass?"
373,yeah I do have it I take picture from inside
373,"then you probably already know about the Canon 5d Mark 3, this is the top end professional camera I think you might seen it already being used by a lot of your colleagues"
373,yes this is a good one I think I've seen my friend use it a lot is this how is this shutter speed of this camera
373,"for faster moving pictures, it will go up to one two thousandth of a second, depending on the effect you want to do and the kind of picture you are taking, it will take a standard shutter speed of 30 seconds or even go to bulb mode, if you want to catch a bit of movement inside a very solid not moving Stadium at night"
373,but you know what previously I use Nikon before my lenses is it okay for that I use Nikon lens with the camera body
373,"they are not directly compatible, what we find as many people change their lens kits over to people who already have Nikon gears here and get up with new Canon lenses"
373,yeah that's what I need to do how much is it
373,this camera body is $2000
373,is it full frame right
373,yes this is full frame
373,yeah you know what thanks so much for your explanation I just want to take a look by myself a little bit
373,"and if you'd like us to set a camera up so that you can work with it on a tripod and so forth, try some different lenses, please let us know and we'll have one of our assistance help you out"
373,okay thanks so much I just real quick question is it possible to try the camera in in your shop
373,certainly
373,yeah why do we give it a try
373,"if you'd like to come over here one of our assistance will set up a camera, do you know what lenses you would like to use it with?"
373,yeah like 1020 should be good
373,okay we'll set up with one of those and a tripod and just take your time
373,yeah you know what this is good camera but I want to think a little bit more so anyway I'll come back later thanks so much for your kind suggestion
373,"no problem come back anytime with anything we can help you with, we'll be here I will keep a camera setup for the next few days for you"
373,thanks so much for your great service so I'll see you later
373,thanks have a great afternoon
374,excuse me
374,how can I help you
374,yeah yeah can you tell me the special features of this camera such as light is over also like you know it's the size and also all the focus point
374,"this camera is designed to take fantastic looking pictures in a very simple but flexible way so you're not going to pay for a top end camera, it's still going to get great shots but there are compromises"
374,what about the price
374,"it's only $550 and for that you get an ISO of 3200, and a slow shutter speed of 30 seconds"
374,so this is like a semi pro camera which is not so expensive
374,it's a way of getting professional results without investing in full professional camera
374,about the modes like how many modes that I can set for you know like sometimes I want to take it easy
374,"it has nine preset mode so you can tell it the environment you are shooting in, and then it will choose some automatic settings for you, if you want to override that that through the menu you've got some pretty easy manual settings that you can get into as well"
374,and it has only one color
374,it's also available in white silver and black
374,okay black is better for me and also this one seems to be nice and comparing to ther model I've seen Canon so even if I'm I'm not going for Pro and I'm not one like a cheap camera so this is a good one
374,"this is designed for what you just described the Nikon that you can see over there, it's a good social camera for friends out taking pictures of each other and posting on Facebook, whereas the Canon over there is a full high end professional camera that can do anything but it comes at a price"
374,I see so this is my be the one that I want
374,but you know what I want to think a little bit more because buying camera I'II use it for you know 3 year 5 years a little bit more about it but anyway thanks so much for your clear explanation
374,"please take this brochure, find our cards attached to it, come back anytime"
374,wow you are so nice so thanks so much and I'm sure I'll come back with this brochure
374,thanks for your time have a great afternoon
374,you too bye bye
375,hello
375,hi how's it going?
375,yeah it's good you know I have no idea about camera much I just want one camera for me that I can take it anywhere I wanted to be look quite good with me don't seem to be too big so you have any idea of like quite small good and also a reasonable price that's my important thing
375,"let's start at the other end maybe, instead of thinking about a camera let's think about the pictures, can I asked what sort of pictures you take?"
375,you know I still don't really know the reason I buy camera is I will go on a trip with my friends so maybe just like humans with friends also like some Countryside  like landscape
375,"so good camera that's fun to use with friends and family, going out having a good time and doing little travel?"
375,that's right
375,"let's have a look at the Nikon just here, it's actually inexpensive, it's $68 and for that you get a 20 megapixel camera that takes beautiful pictures"
375,expensive but you have cheaper than this this is the cheapest one
375,cheaper than this doesn't exist anymore it's been taken over by mobile phone
375,you're right and this one seemed to be very easy to use only one color
375,it comes in a number of colors we have it in purple pink black silver and red
375,you have all colors right now
375,"all colors are in stock and ready to go, but please try to take a picture with it"
375,looks nice and match what I want how much is it zoom you know I want to zoom in and zoom out
375,"one of the advantages of a camera over mobile phone is it has an optical zoom, and this has a 5x optic zoom,  you are moving the lens instead of just cropping down to a smaller picture, so on the zoom the pictures is much higher quality than on the phone"
375,lastly how many modes they have in it
375,"you can set this camera up so it's just point and shoot, and it's very responsive you never have to think about it, or you can use 18 preset modes or the glamour modes so that you can put special effects on photos or just tell the camera what environments you are in so it can choose the best settings"
375,maybe this is what I want
375,please try putting it in your pocket feel like for weight and how heavy it is
375,okay okay
375,yeah it seems good fit in my pockets I see not too big not too small and I think it's good its kind of Handy you know it's good for me to grasp it uh how much is it
375,it's only $68
375,I said yeah I'm still a little expensive anyway you know I have come back in and I'll talk to you later so thanks so much
375,thanks for your time have a good afternoon
375,alright see you
376,good afternoon how can I help?
376,oh good afternoon you know I was looking for one camera my first camera and my house we always use from Sony so I was looking for a Sony camera I'm not so sure this is the best for me or not is this good for me do you recommend this one is it
376,what would you like to do with photography? do you want to be practice and take better shots or do you just want to go out with the family and friends and have a good time?
376,yeah maybe the last one I just want to go out with my friend taking picture with friend that's it
376,"the Sony is a great camera but it's designed to take top end professional style pictures in a smaller camera package, so it's priced around $550"
376,expensive I guess you have silver model
376,"over here we have the Nikon Coolpix, and it's designed to be a good family and friends camera to go out and have fun with you, and to be very easy to use, it has great picture quality at 20 megapixel sensor"
376,wow maybe this is better for me this is nikon right so how is Nikon comparing to other two models is it a good brand
376,"it's an excellent Brand and generally Nikon are more Cooperative with retailers , better customer service than Sony, Sony has had some customer issues lately"
376,is only one color
376,this comes in a number of colors that comes in purple pink black silver and red
376,I see what about the setting is it easy for you know my first camera I don't want it to be that difficult I want to be super easy to use
376,"point and shoot, it's very responsive you can set it up so that's what you really have to do, switch it on, point at what you want to take a picture, and press the shutter button, and you have a beautiful photo every time"
376,nice you know but maybe this time I record with nikon because Sony's seem to be more expensive I want to ask you a little bit more about zooming because you know now I'm using iphone and it cannot zoom much how good is it for optical zoom
376,"this does have an optical zoom 5 times, if you zoom in the iPhone it's a digital zoom which just makes a picture smaller but it makes equality worse, here the qualities good through every point of the zoom"
376,okay thanks so much for your detailed explanation I just want to compare them a little bit and if I want to buy it I'll let you know
376,"certainly, have a look around feel free to ask any other questions I'll just be here"
376,thank you so much
376,thanks for your time have a good afternoon
377,good afternoon how can I help you?
377,hello  you know I am a journalist so I want a professional camera I don't want crop frame I want full frame camera even though it's kind of expensive it's fine so can you guide me to your professional camera in your shop
377,are you a print journalists do you work for an internet site or?
377,actually I printed I have to send my pictures to the publisher so yeah I wanted full frame so I need it with better quality of image
377,can I just check if you write the copy that goes with that or you're the journalist who writes a story?
377,no  I don't I just take pictures you know my work is just taking pictures
377,so you are actually a photo journalist and you're used to working with these cameras yourself?
377,yes that's right
377,you probably heard of the Canon 5d Mark 3 and you probably seen it in the field
377,actually I use nikon all the time but yeah maybe canon is also interesting why don't you give me some suggestion how good is this camera
377,"this camera has full creative manual control, you can do anything you want with it, it is designed to be a top end photojournalism camera which is why we sell it as a body only and no lenses, anything you want to do this camera can do it"
377,I see how about the weight you know recently I getting older I don't want to have to a heavy camera
377,"all camera in this range again weigh about one kilo for the body, and 1 to 20 kilos for the lens so that's how it goes in that business I guess"
377,all those professional camera are heavy how about the auto focus Point previous one got like 40 how about this one
377,"this has a 61 autofocus points, some of its competitors have up to 200 points, but what canon have done is they worked out some artificial intelligence software so by having less data better thought out it's very responsive and accurate"
377,it's interesting what about the iso sometime I take pictures at night
377,"it goes up to 6400 ISO so in light conditions, excellent performance"
377,oh I see thanks so much uh yeah right
377,"yes it's full frame and just another thing I want to check is this something your business is helping with, or is it something you need to buy personally?"
377,I need to buy personally
377,we have some business packages available so depending on how you want to approach it that you're going to claim this for tax we can structure different packages
377,so yeah that's nice that's really good promotion but you know I want I want check about this model before I buy it it's kinda expensive you know maybe I'll come back
377,"okay come back anytime we'll set one up so you can have a bit of work with it as well, just let us know we'll do anything to help you out while you look into these cameras"
377,thanks so much. You're very nice to me. See you later I'll come back
377,thanks for your time have a good afternoon to you too
377,you too take care too
378,good afternoon how can I help?
378,oh yeah I was looking for a camera to be honest I know nothing about it it's my first time trying to buy a camera so it will be very nice if you can give me some suggestion and also help me a little bit about the camera specification
378,what sort of pictures are you interested in?
378,it's tough just taking picture with friend I am not going to be professional for sure
378,"family pictures, friends, conferences, parties, that sort of thing?"
378,oh it's different I thought it's the same maybe go with all those
378,yeah they are all the same so you're looking for a camera that can be as sociable as you are?
378,yes I wanted if it's possible I want one camera that being good in every situation did I ask too much
378,"I think you know exactly what you want and we have exactly the camera that will work for you, please pick this one up and try to take a couple pictures"
378,you can see the picture quality is excellent and it's extremely easy to use
378,yeah that's right I don't need to do anything you know I just press it and everything was fine this is great sorry how much is it
378,it's only $68 it also takes nice travel pictures too
378,$68 is not expensive at all is it easy to use you know I have heard that camera has many setting I don't want to mess up
378,"this has a lot of different settings if you choose to look into that, different settings that help you say to the camera while I'm at the beach or in the snow, please choose the best settings for that situation but you don't have to use those if you don't want to"
378,so you mean if I go to the beach there is beach mode or if I go to the mountain this mountain is that is it like that
378,it's easy but if it's a little complicated you just choose your favorite settings stay there and point and shoot
378,you know what I will do what you see I don't want to set much so what about color  I don't have to like this color do you have any kinds of colors
378,"we have the silver on display because of being very popular, but it also comes in purple pink black and red"
378,you know what I like pink camera so maybe you have pink camera in your stock
378,absolutely we also have some accessories that go with a camera such a Snoopy stickers and so forth
378,I see I need to confirm with my friend you know he also knows well about camera so I was asking for it better this is a good one and I'm sure come back to your shop
378,if you're talking with your friend please take this brochure as well and that will give him some specifications to help with the comparisons
378,maybe not because my friend knows Wells about camera so we will look it up on the internet but anyway thanks so much for your time
378,no problem have a good afternoon
378,thanks so much
379,hello
379,how can I help you?
379,yeah this is this is I guess this is a professional camera right it seems to be big I have got previous one and this is the new model right
379,"yes this is a Canon 5d Mark 3, have you got the Mark 2 now?"
379,yeah that's right you know what this is for my professional work recently I'm getting older and every time I go out with my family I don't want to bring what kind of thing you know and come up with a lot of lens I am looking for something lightweight and also good quality I am also concerned with exposure so you have to know what kind of semi pro model
379,"of course, we have the Sony over here, if you heard of the alpha a6000 which is designed to take really good pictures, the qualities what you are used to from the larger professional cameras, but it's very lightweight, you put a lightweight lens on it and it's great for family pictures and so forth"
379,I see uh yeah it's really good weight comparing to the big one how much is it sorry I am sorry not how much is it how about the weight how is it
379,"with a 35 mil lens at the moment, that's $550 and half a kilogram"
379,what about the sensor size is it like a full frame
379,"it's a three-quarter aps-c sensor, so it will still give you great resolution and so forth, but in some ways you have to rethink some of your calculations for how your lenses work"
379,I got you yeah about the auto focus Point how how many points do this camera has it
379,"it has 179 autofocus points, very responsive, very accurate"
379,I see I am also saw the Nikon camera how was it compared to this one
379,"come over here, Let's have a look"
379,"it has an excellent 20 megapixel sensor, what you will find with this is it's got a  much smaller amount of glass in the lens, so much smaller lens land surface area, so the pictures through the lens won't be as good as the other cameras you are used to"
379,I see how how much is it
379,the sony is $550 but the Nikon is only $68
379,but you know what maybe I want something a little bit professional I want to be able to adjust so much things even though I use compact one I want to adjust a lot of things so even though it's more expensive I go back to sony just one question how about the optical zoom
379,"with the Sony you can actually change lenses, so you can have  the kind of Zoom that you what have,  you just have to buy that different lens to the kit lens its on, This is a limited, to the installed lens which is a 5 times optical zoom"
379,I got you so this one I cannot remove the lens the other one I can have many lens so maybe sony is better but you know anyway I look around a little bit thanks so much for guide me you know many camera model
379,no problem any other questions I'll just be here come back anytime have a good afternoon
379,yeah alright see you
380,hello
380,good afternoon how can I help
380,yeah you know I was looking for a camera even though I am scientist I am not good at technology I was looking for a camera that is super easy to use you have any idea about that
380,"This Nikon Coolpix is very straightforward, it's the first step up from a mobile phone camera and it's just as flexible, just point and shoot"
380,yeah this one might be right for me is it the easiest to use an easy to use to use model in this shop
380,"absolutely, if you set it up the right way which we can do for you here in the shop, it's just point and shoot, if you want to be a little more creative there are some options in there but they're all set through a menu, it's impossible to fall into them accidentally"
380,I see yeah yeah I don't actually mind I think this is quite good design and compared to others I think it's quite good how much is it
380,"it's only $68 and it's design to be a very sociable camera pictures, pictures of friends, family, conferences, that sort of thing"
380,I see only one colors you know I don't like silver
380,"if you like purple pink black or red, we have those as well"
380,you know sometimes I take pictures with my girlfriend and she wanna look nice do you have any sort of like you know effects like to make pictures better
380,"it has 12 glamour retouch effects such as Skin softening, small face, big eyes, that kind of thing you see a lot of people put up on Facebook"
380,you know this might be the right one for me what about the others that one is very big and that one also has the same size compare to the Sony one which one is better when you think I should buy
380,"that depends on the use, how you are going to use it, the Sony camera over there is designed to take pictures that are almost as good as a top end professional camera"
380,I see yeah but I want simple cheap and nice design anyway still a little expensive  let me think a little bit more maybe one or two days and I hope I come back soon
380,"any time any further questions please call in, we will be happy to help have a good afternoon"
380,thank you so much I'll see you

383,yeah exactly exactly that
383,do you take many travel pictures?
383,yeah yeah I don't like to take pictures but I'm not very good at it
383,"maybe you are interested in this camera over here, this is the Nikon Coolpix and it's point-and-shoot very fast, very responsive, it's really good for going out with friends or going to a conference"
383,oh actually had that sounds like that's what I'm looking for and how much does it cost
383,this is only $68
383,well that's very cheap and uh huh is it still good quality to pictures
383,"it has a 20 megapixel sensor so the pictures look great, you can do a few extra enlargements or so forth, if you are out with a girlfriend or if you are out with your kids or nephews and nieces, what have you, you can get some nice pics for the wall"
383,great and do you have only this color or are there any other colors
383,"we have purple pink black silver and red, and it's also very light, it's only 120 grams, pick it up and try it"
383,see how it fits in your pocket
383,would you like to try taking couple pictures with it
383,"as I said it's basically point and shoot but it's got a lot of a the preset mode, so if you're at for the snow on the beach or somewhere, an environment where you want to have a little more control and tell the camera what settings to choose you can do that, but you don't have to go you can choose auto settings"
383,any other questions
383,come back anytime thank you have a good afternoon
383,good afternoon how can I help
383,can I ask what sort of pictures to take
383,so you're looking for something that will give you great picture results without the weight of a top end camera?
383,"this is the Sony Alpha a6000, it's fairly light for a camera that takes such good pictures, that's around about half a kilogram, please pick it up and see how you how it feels in the hand"
383,oh yeah actually it's very light that's nice and it feels nice to touch the material is good
383,see how it fits in your pocket
383,yeah it fits no problem there is no issue there it's a very nice camera
383,would you like to try taking couple pictures with it?
383,okay yeah sure why not
383,yeah I think it takes very good pictures
383,"as I said it's basically point and shoot but it's got a lot of a the preset mode, so if you're at for the snow on the beach or somewhere, an environment where you want to have a little more control and tell the camera what settings to choose you can do that, but you don't have to go you can choose auto settings"
383,okay alright that's good to know thank you thank you thank you very much
383,any other questions?
383,I think I'm set for now think that's what I think you can come back anytime thanks for telling have a good afternoon
383,come back anytime thank you have a good afternoon
384,hello
384,good afternoon how can I help?
384,I'm looking for a nice camera
384,can I ask what sort of pictures you take?
384,yeah I like to take it you know it seems especially on Sunrise Sunset and uh yeah when I travel
384,so you're looking for something that will give you great picture results without the weight of a top end camera?
384,yeah exactly that's what I'm thinking
384,"this is the Sony Alpha a6000, it's fairly light for a camera that takes such good pictures, that's around about half a kilogram, please pick it up and see how you how it feels in the hand"
384,oh yeah that's very good
384,try taking a picture with it
384,yeah I think it's a very good pictures
384,"it's got a lot of autofocus points on it so it can follow anything that's moving in the frame to make sure that it stays in crisp focus, it's got a lot of preset modes as well so you can tell what environment you are shooting in"
384,great under how about the ISO
384,"it goes up to 3200 so you get really nice pictures in fairly low light, up to late evening"
384,great that's great I know what's it sensor size
384,"it's a three-quarter cropped aps-c sensor so that actually means it's going to give your great pictures, but it's a price compromise without going up to full frame which is going to quadruple the price"
384,that one is very good and uh can you advise me any other camera
384,"the other camera that would take really good shots is over here, it's the Canon 5d Mark 3"
384,"please pick this one up, it weighs 1 kilograms without lens"
384,wow that's material
384,"it's a top end professional camera, it gives you full creative control but as you can see, it comes at a number of costs, one is the price and the other side is the weight"
384,and uh how much is the price
384,without a lens $2000
384,wow
384,"so you can see the Sony at a quarter of the price takes pictures that are almost as good, it's a good compromise"
384,yeah I think you're right now
384,it's a lot to think about
384,"perhaps you'd like this brochure that has specs on the sony, and this one that has specs on the Canon, I'm not saying the Canon is necessary a good choice, but it gives you an idea of what's out there something, a little interesting reading"
384,yeah I think that that's great I'll take a look at that and probably help me you know decide
384,any questions you have come in any time and we're happy to discuss with you
384,that's great thank you very much for your help
384,thank you have a good afternoon
385,hello
385,good afternoon how can I help?
385,I'm just looking for a camera
385,can I ask what sort of pictures you take?
385,standard pictures out on the beach with friends
385,"this is the Nikon Coolpix, it's a really good sociable camera will go wherever you go, it's very lightweight, just point and shoot so when you want to take a picture it's very responsive, please pick it up see how it goes"
385,oh yeah it's cool I think it's very light and it feels good
385,"feel free to take a couple of pictures with that, it's just point and shoot switch it on and press the shutter button"
385,yeah actually looks very good
385,"you can see you can view them and blow up the pictures, you can see the quality that's coming off the 20 megapixel sensor"
385,yeah there's a really good even in the small screen the details are good
385,"it comes a number of colors as well, so if style is an issue you can have it in black silver red purple white"
385,yeah I think I would like my favorite color is black but but this also look good
385,"there are some other cameras out there that maybe take better pictures but they that come at a much higher price tag, at 68 dollars you'll get some great shots you can enlarge, the next step up is over $500"
385,well that's actually I think a little little bit over my budget
385,sounds like this is the camera for you
385,"indeed I think that will be great, but I will still think about it and see what I do that anyway thank you very much for your help"
385,thanks for your time have a great afternoon
385,thank you
386,hello
386,good afternoon how can I help?
386,I'm looking for a new camera
386,can I ask what sort of pictures you take?
386,um yeah it depends you know when I travel I like to take pictures of the scenes and everything
386,are you used to using a top end professional camera?
386,yeah I actually had one that was really good but I did it got stolen so now I need I want to get a new one but even better
386,"this is the Canon 5d Mark 3 you may have heard about it, it's a photojournalism camera with full creative control, everything can be set manually, a wide range of lenses that you buy separate of course"
386,oh yeah I think I've heard about the one they said it's a really good camera and what is the iso setting for this camera
386,"it goes up to 6400 ISO so you can take great pictures in low light without a Flash, and you won't get much noise in those pictures, it's a very high quality full frame sensor"
386,very nice indeed how much does it cost
386,the camera body here is $2000
386,can I ask if your last camera is a Canon?
386,oh yeah actually it was but I think the previous model
386,how old are The lenses that you have now?
386,about 2 years can I still use them
386,yes if you have Canon lenses that are two years old they will be compatible with this body
386,oh I see so that's a big advantage in for this camera
386,"it's already a lot, save you a fortune, lenses can be quite expensive, but some do you have a favorite setup that you like to work with this camera?"
386,yeah I do actually I do it
386,come over here we can set this camera body up for you with the lens of your choice and you can have a play with it give it a go
386,oh that will be great yeah thank you let's try it
386,"I'll just leave you here with our assistant and he'll be able to step through all the functions with you and set it up, and even provide you with some subjects and some ideas and even discuss the detail with you"
386,ok
386,if you have any other questions please feel free to ask
386,alright thank you very much
386,okay that's good thank you very much thank you

387,good afternoon how can I help?
387,I'm actually looking for a camera
387,have you been thinking about a particular kind of camera?
387,I'm not really actually just so you know simple one and cheap
387,can I ask what sort of pictures you take?
387,yeah some safari with friends you know in a group and everything
387,so you're looking for a camera that's good in social situations maybe a few travel pics from time to time?
387,yeah yeah exactly that yeah
387,"the Nikon Coolpix is an ordinary a simple small point and shoot camera that gives you great pictures with very little to think about with it, it's great for going out with friends and taking great pictures on the spur of the moment"
387,that sounds good and how much does it cost
387,68 dollars
387,very cheap
387,anything cheaper than this has been replaced by mobile phones
387,"you can see it's very light, it's only 120 grams and small so it fits in a pocket"
387,is it easy to use where can I just shoot pictures with it
387,"yes it is, point and shoot, switch it On, press the shutter Button and you have a picture, and it always looks great"
387,can I try it
387,"sure, please do"
387,oh yeah actually it's very simple and it works well
387,"it has some other modes, preset modes glamour modes and so forth, if they don't interest you you don't have to use them"
387,"I said does it have like you know the thing where you can retouch the pictures you take, like a glamour mode"
387,"skin retouching that sort of thing, skin softening, small face, big eyes, like you see on Facebook?"
387,yeah yeah yeah
387,"it's got a dozen of those settings, I think you have a lot of fun with it"
387,that sounds great. I think that's my camera that's perfect
387,that's great is there anything else? I can offer you a brochure for that camera today
387,oh yes please I'd like to get a brochure and then I'll think about it a bit more but I think that's the right one
387,great or we could sell you one to use right away
387,I just came to take a look but I will probably get one later
387,"okay you look forward to seeing you again, thanks so much for your time"
387,yeah thank you for your help
388,hello good morning
388,good afternoon how can I help?
388,I want to take a look at your cameras
388,"this one here is excellent, it takes pictures that are as good as a top-end professional model but it's a quarter of the price"
388,oh really and what about the price how much does it cost
388,550 dollars
388,oh well that's that's a little bit too expensive for me I just want a simple one
388,"do you take a lot of pictures of family and friends that kind of thing, parties, conferences?"
388,yeah I think that's what I'm going to use it for
388,"okay this little camera here is the next step up from a mobile phone camera, basically very flexible, takes fantastic pictures but it's just point and shoot, very simple to use"
388,okay. I think that's more like my camera than the other one
388,you're free to take some pictures with it if you like
388,okay
388,you're actually looks right and how much does it cost
388,68 dollars
388,oh well that's great if that's good and the weight
388,"it's only 120 grams, have a feel of the weight again, tried putting it in your pocket, it's really good the way it just goes around with you, quite simple"
388,yeah you're right it does And uh and what's the quality of the pictures
388,it has a 20 megapixel sensor so the pictures come out of a good resolution and you can make some nice enlargements
388,yeah I think that's enough Sounds good
388,can ask what color you might like?
388,I don't know yet I don't really care about you know the color but as long as it's easy to use that's what I want
388,perfect I just mentioned because it comes in five different colors and some people are fussy but we have all colors in stock
388,alright that's good to know that's very good yeah
388,is there anything else I can help you with?
388,do you have any other cameras that are in this kind
388,the Nikon Coolpix is the only model we carry at the moment
388,okay very well I am I always think about it I knew it thank you very much for your help
388,thanks for time have a good afternoon
389,hello
389,good afternoon how can I help?
389,I'm looking to buy a new camera
389,can I ask what sort of pictures you take?
389,oh yeah all types of pictures of when I travel you know clothes sceneries all kinds
389,what kind of camera you been using in the past?
389,Canon but the old model
389,"let's have a look at this one now, this is the 5d Mark 3, fully interchangeable lenses and so forth, you have full creative control, everything can be set manually, it has 61 autofocus points which is fewer points than the previous model but the software has been changed so it's much more responsive and quite smart"
389,oh yeah actually I've been looking at this one for quite some time it's a great upgrade from my old camera
389,do you still have all your old lenses?
389,yeah actually I do even the camera but this one is much better
389,the lenses should be fully compatible with this body if you have the Mark 2 right now
389,oh yeah that's pretty good pretty good but how much does it cost
389,"for this body 2000 dollars, if you pick it up and feel the weight it's something you're used to, it still weigh around about 1 kilogram"
389,yeah actually it's very similar to the old one but that's quite expensive
389,"it's about the same price as the previous model which is really quite something, it means that you're getting better technology years later at the same price, it hasn't gone up with inflation at all"
389,i see
389,what what's the exposure how long how high does it go
389,"the standard shutter speed is still set at 30 seconds for the slowest but it still has a bulb mode that works really well, so after 30 seconds you could go into bulb mode and  take out an exposure that's  infinitely long, so if you want to shoot a star trail or something for 5 or 6 hours this camera can do that"
389,perfect that's really good and you have any other model but a little bit cheaper
389,"there is a cheaper model over here that takes pictures that are almost as good but it has some limits and compromises, it's $550"
389,oh yeah but actually that's not better than my camera I think I need the canon one
389,yes you give up a lot of control when you go back to the Sony
389,yeah so anyway. But it's a lot of money so I'll think about it a bit more and decided
389,"here is a spec sheet you might like to take with it and our card, come in anytime, we're happy to work with with you figuring out the features of the camera, when you're ready just let us know we will set one up so you can give it a try"
389,all right that's very helpful thank you very much thank you for your help
389,thanks for your time have a good afternoon
390,good afternoon how can I help?
390,I am here to take a look at your cameras
390,can I ask for sort of pictures you take?
390,oh yeah I like to take pictures of scenes when I travel
390,what sort of areas do you like to travel in?
390,mostly exotic areas you know it by the Sea so on the coast
390,so a camera that's very heavy would get in your way?
390,um yeah probably I'm looking for something lightweight but good quality
390,"this Sony camera takes pictures that are almost as good as a top end professional camera, but it only has half the weight, please pick it up and have a try"
390,I actually do it this weighs alright how much is it
390,"this is only $550, so it's a quarter to a fifth of price of a high-end professional camera"
390,the picture quality is almost as good as those because it's a mirrorless camera there's a lot of saving in the weight
390,oh that's great how about the iso settings
390,it goes up to 3200 so it's pretty good in low light up to late evening then it'll take those pictures without much noise
390,does it have an artistic effect mode
390,"it has some artistic effects built in such as soft focus, toy camera, black and white, some of those things you are used to seeing in mobile phone apps"
390,"it'll connect through USB so you can upload directly onto Facebook, Flickr, and so forth"
390,that's good that's very good I like it when do you have other models in this area
390,"it's only the price system really well at this point in the market, other manufacturers still have to catch up"
390,okay good and what if I want a better one how much is it
390,"the Canon 5d Mark 3 over here is a top end professional camera, the body only costs $2000, picture quality is slightly better than the Sony camera because it's designed for print publication"
390,but that's too expensive for me so I think I'll stick with the Sony yeah
390,yeah it's an excellent camera for the price
390,uh yeah ok very well that's good to know alright I'll still think about it and let you know thank you very much for your help
390,"no problem come in anytime we can show you more features, thanks your time"
390,thank you have a good day
391,I want to get a new camera
391,have you use a camera before?
391,only doing the phone actually I've never owned like a real camera
391,"what sort of pictures are you thinking of, you want to take that the phone can't do?"
391,I don't know but it's just a picture I take with the phone are really bad so I think I should get a real camera
391,"I understand, are you happy with the way the phone cameras work in general like point-and-shoots and those kinds of pictures?"
391,yeah actually that's what I should get a really simple one
391,"this is a point and shoot camera, it's great for parties, dinners, family, going to the beach and some basic travel shots, but it's got much better picture quality than a mobile phone"
391,"where mobile phone has a plastic lens this as a glass lens, so already it's going to be tougher and it's not going to  scratch and distort"
391,how much does it cost
391,68 dollars
391,oh wow that's really cheap really cheap it does it still take it you know good cameras can I try it
391,"please try, it has a 20 megapixel sensor so you'll get beautiful pictures, it also has a 5x optical zoom so if you want a zoom in closer on your people or people's faces, the picture quality Remains the Same, and it's always excellent"
391,oh yeah it looks very much better than my phone actually yeah i quite like it
391,"try putting it in your pocket and feeling the weight, it's incredibly light and it will go everywhere"
391,yep it's no problem at all
391,it's the kind of camera you can have with you all the time
391,it's actually very cheap so if I lose it today I won't have a big problem
391,"these are very popular camera so please don't lose it, you will lose your photos but yes it's easy to replace if it comes to that"
391,is it easy to use or can I have like some settings and everything
391,"you can set it up as a point and shoot camera or you can tell it some of the environment to shooting in with the preset modes such as beach, mountains, it also has glamour retouch effects so that you can do some things like change the shape and size of faces skin retouching before you post to Facebook"
391,oh yeah very well that all sounds really good
391,"it comes in a number of  other colors as well, I don't know if that's important for you"
391,I don't know I think that one is fine but I'll have to see the other ones I guess
391,"okay if you'd like to look around the other models that are available, they are all in this corner please feel free to browse if you have any other questions I'll just be here"
391,alright I think that I thought that was good enough for today but also think about us anyway thank you very much for your help thank you
391,thank you have a great afternoon
391,thank you sir
392,good afternoon how can I help?
392,hello
392,I'm here to see the cameras I want a new one
392,can I ask what kind of pictures you take?
392,I like to do in a portrait or close up pictures
392,have you had a camera before?
392,yeah actually I did but I am looking for a better one
392,"this is a high in photojournalism camera, so creatively you can do anything you wanted to do, it as full manual settings with a wide range of accessories and lenses"
392,oh yeah it's a bit heavy how much does it weigh
392,the camera body is one kilogram and then of course the lens will weigh more again
392,in the studio it would be mostly set up on a tripod
392,okay and how long is the exposure
392,"the normal shutter speed goes up to 30 seconds, if you wanted to go longer than that this camera has a bulb mode so you can keep the shutter open for as long as you choose"
392,does it have a auto focus
392,"that depends on the lens you attach, if you have a lens is compatible with autofocus, this camera has a new system with 61 auto focus points and artificial intelligence built into the software so it can be very responsive and very accurate"
392,it has a full frame sensor comparable to a 35 mil Raymond filmed thinking back to the old days
392,well very good how much does this one cost
392,the camera body is $2000
392,that's not cheap
392,"it's a top-end professional camera, so the prices has been very stable, they haven't gone up for about four or five years while the features have improved but they have never been changed"
392,we have a more affordable camera that still takes fantastic pictures comparable in quality
392,"the Sony Alpha a6000 is a little bit reduced for a manual settings, and it has no bulb mode, so it's a bit of a creative compromise but it's a mirrorless camera so it weighs much less"
392,oh yeah actually that's good but this is still taking or professional quality pictures
392,"yes it does, it has a three quarter size sensor, but the pictures of that are almost as good as the pictures from the 5d Mark 3, only a professional could tell the difference"
392,this one is better for me for now
392,and it only costs $550 so it is a quarter of the price
392,for the exposure of this one is it the same as the other one
392,"The iso only goes up to 3200 so it's performance is almost as good, but it will take good night time pictures, low light pictures, up to roundabout  Twilight, just after that the performance begins to drop off little but there's no noise in the pictures,  there's still very high quality"
392,yeah I think that's good enough for a 1 hour
392,is there anything else I can help you with today?
392,uh actually that's alright you've already been very helpful thank you thank you very much
392,please feel free to come. Please feel free to come back anytime. and we can help you if you have all the questions have a good afternoon
392,thank you you too
393,I want to look at your camera
393,can I ask what sort of pictures you take?
393,you know normal pictures with friends
393,"going out parties, conferences, that sort of thing?"
393,yeah I know about that I think that's pretty much it
393,"this cameras is ideal for that, it's the next step up from a mobile phone camera, so it can take pictures in a point-and-shoot sort of easy way, but the quality is so much better"
393,oh yeah that's good and easy to use
393,"it's very easy to use, as it set up now, all you have to do is switch it on and press the shutter button, and you'll take a great picture"
393,can I try
393,sure
393,oh yeah you're right it's a really good and how much does this one cost
393,this is only $68
393,oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah cheap
393,and it has a 20 megapixel sensor so the pictures are good enough that you can make some nice enlargements as well
393,can I add also effects on the pictures
393,"it has some glamour retouching modes where you can add some Styles and change face shape and so forth, the way you seen on Facebook, 12 of those effects are built in it"
393,great great that's really good do you have it in other colors
393,we've got it in purple black pink silver and red
393,"how did you find the weight, it's only 120 grams"
393,yeah I think it's good it's very light
393,it's all about taking pictures rather than thinking too much about the camera
393,and are the manual settings is also easy to use
393,"the manual settings are fairly limited, and they put it in the menu system so people don't go into them by accident, the idea to keep it simple and automatic"
393,"you will find it's got HDMI output as well, a lot of people like to show their pictures on their HDTV"
393,oh yeah that's that's all right I think that's good you can also zoom in with it
393,"it's got a 5 times optical zoom so you can zoom in and the quality will remain the same, a little bit different to your mobile phone where zooming drops equality a lot"
393,okay so it's not the same kind of zoom
393,it's an optical zoom that actually moves the lens physically
393,oh okay yeah that's a really good camera do you advise me do you advise any other cameras
393,"there are several of the cameras from other manufacturers, but I think this is probably the most popular, this is the one we are carrying lately"
393,oh okay I see well thank you very much thank you for all your time
393,"thanks for your time, come back and have a great afternoon"
394,hello
394,good afternoon how can I help?
394,I'm looking to buy a new camera
394,can I ask what sort of pictures you take?
394,yeah it depends I like to take close up pictures or sometimes it seems that depends on the moment
394,"do you take many social pictures as well, like that going out with friends or family, going to parties and conferences?"
394,yes and sometimes well actually I like to I preferred to take pictures of the nature
394,how much creative control do you need for the camera?
394,um yeah I like to have a lot of control because sometimes I take in low light or something in dark lights so I like my camera to have a lot of available settings
394,so you need it to reflect your imagination with how you want to respond to the scene
394,yeah exactly
394,"you'll be looking at the top end professional camera with full manual settings, this is the Canon 5d Mark 3, if it can be set manually on any camera can be set manually on this camera, it's designed to handle any conditions in any place at any time according to what you want to do"
394,oh yes so actually this is top of the line right
394,yes it is
394,how much does this cost
394,the camera body alone is 2000 dollars
394,wow thats expensive
394,"and you can feel the price in the weight as well, it almost weighs a kilogram before you put a lens on it"
394,yeah actually that's that's right what do I get for this weight in terms of unit performance
394,"yeah the iso goes up to 6400, so you're getting very little noise in excellent low light photographs, it also has a full size sensor, the sensor size is comparable to an old 35 mil frame of film which means that it has fantastic quality, when you get to this level you stop measuring megapixels and you start to measure in terms of the output that's possible and the file format you're creating"
394,wow that's really interesting
394,most people who use this camera shoots at a format called RAW so that they can do some photo editing afterwards without it falling apart
394,that's what I like to do so
394,most of the leading software has filters built-in to accept the photos straight from this camera in raw format
394,oh okay that's really good and there is it still compatible with the old lenses
394,can I ask what sort of camera you used?
394,I think also Canon
394,how old are The lenses you have?
394,it's not very old I think maybe one or two years
394,"they will be compatible, if you want you can bring your lenses in and try them with your body to make sure they work as you expect"
394,uh yeah actually uh I think I do. I really like it but I have to check that the lenses work
394,"come in anytime and we will give you some time, set you up over here so that you can have a play with the camera test your lenses"
394,thank you that's very nice of you thank you
394,no problem see you again
394,okay thank you have a good day
394,have a good afternoon
395,good afternoon how can I help you?
395,hello I just want to take a look at your camera
395,sure can I ask what sort of pictures you take?
395,standard pictures you know
395,so a sociable sort of camera that goes to parties and conferences and the beach?
395,yeah I think that's what I want like a basic one
395,"this camera is really good, it is only $68, it's incredibly light, feel it up pick it up feel the weights"
395,oh yeah that's light
395,"it takes fantastic pictures, it's got a 20 megapixel sensor"
395,well that's good can I try it
395,"sure, take a few pictures"
395,yeah that looks good
395,"if you can see the replay button there, just pop it on replay, and we can have a look at how some of the pictures blow up so you can check the detail"
395,you're the picture looks good but the screen is a little bit too small for me
395,"mostly what people do is they download the pictures on a computer, or plugged the camera to the TV to have them look at the most biggest screen"
395,and does it have a zoom
395,"it has of five times optical zoom, so you can affect the framing of your picture, you can go in closeer or back out a little further like you can on your mobile phone, but the quality remains the same throughout the whole period, you know how it goes bad on your mobile phone, here it's always great"
395,oh yeah I think yeah that's better
395,"it has the manual setting so if you want to try a bit of creative control, that's an option but they're  in a menu system so you won't bang them on accident, it's a point and shoot camera"
395,yeah I think that's mostly what I will do. Just take standard pictures
395,"there's a few preset modes too, so if you are in different environments you can squeeze extra performance out of it, but mostly for people, yeah just point and shoot"
395,okay yeah that sounds very nice to know you still think about it and take a look at the other cameras
395,"no worries, have a great afternoon come back anytime"
395,thank you very much thank you
396,hello
396,good afternoon how can I help?
396,I'm looking I am here to take a look at your cameras I need to take some pictures of a trip oh you know for Naturals and everything
396,so you need some travel pictures not just pictures of family and friends that sort of thing?
396,no actually I'm traveling mostly to take pictures so I want to have a good camera
396,have you had a camera before?
396,um yeah I used to use one but I don't own it anymore I want to latest model
396,what kind of work are you doing with the camera?
396,mostly photo shooting in a forest and sceneries everything
396,"so you're a professional, and this is a tough and professional camera, the latest Canon 5d Mark 3"
396,oh yeah I should I know this wanted so very good camera how long is what's the iso setting for this one
396,"the iso is the same as the previous model on 6400 so you can take great pictures in low-light, the sensor has been improved so there's a lot less noise the pictures now really crisp and clean even in low light"
396,oh very  good and is the weight still the same
396,"yes it's still almost a kilogram without a lens, but it is a top end professional camera, there's a lot of circuitry in a robust body and mirror mechanism as well"
396,how much does it cost right now
396,"this body is 2000 dollars, do you have old lenses that would be compatible?"
396,yeah I think I do for this brand I think probably
396,would you like to test the lenses here with the camera body?
396,oh yeah actually I should I don't have been with me about I very much like Yeah
396,"if you want to come in sometime, we're usually fairly quiet around about eleven a.m. on Saturday morning, we can set up a focus chart then you can test your lenses with this body"
396,oh okay actually just that sound very good. I think I will do. And then decide
396,"okay just come on in, we might see you on Saturday"
396,well that's good can I try it
396,thanks for your time have a great afternoon
397,hi how can I help?
397,I just want to take a quick look at your cameras
397,"we have three basic models, would you like me to explain the layout of the shop?"
397,Yelp
397,over here we have the top end professional cameras around about $2000 and you buy lens separately
397,"over here we have the semi-pro models, they take great photographs that's a quarter the price but there is some compromise as to how much artistic control you have"
397,"over here are the cameras you take to go out, take pictures with friends go to the beach and some basic travel shots"
397,yeah I think those that that's better for me but does it still take good photos
397,"this particular camera the Nikon Coolpix takes excellent photo, that's why we got it displayed in the front, and has a 20 megapixel sensor and can easily be set up to be a straight-out point shoot camera but it also has 18 preset modes and some glamour effect like you've seen on Facebook"
397,how much does all this cost
397,68 dollars
397,what only 68.
397,think of it is thirty times better than your mobile phone camera for probably only twenty times more the price
397,yeah that's sounds too good to be true actually but it's really good
397,please take some pictures with that you can check the quality for yourself
397,you can take a picture very quickly
397,"the two most important things with this kind of camera is that the pictures are great quality because everybody's going to look at them, and then it can respond very quickly because it's all about being out with friends and family"
397,and you know in different conditions do I have to manually set up what I just take pictures
397,"you can keep it set on full auto if you want, if you're traveling and you're in different environments from time to time and you think maybe you can do with some suggestions then you have some preset modes that way you can say I'm at the beach, I am at the snow, I'm in the mountains, that sort of thing"
397,but it's still very simple
397,yes and presets are all in the menu system so they're very hard to get into by accident
397,so in this area this is the best camera you think
397,"I think so, people are very happy with the results and we have the fewest Returns on these cameras compared to some of the other brands"
397,okay okay well thank you very much for your help
397,no problem anytime have a great afternoon
398,hello good morning
398,hi how can I help?
398,I want to look at the new cameras that you have
398,"we have three new models in store at the moment, we have the full professional model, we have the sociable camera for your family and friends, we have a semi pro model pictures you take"
398,I like to take a good picture of the other insects and plants and everything but I'm still quite a ameture so I don't want to invest too much
398,"let's have a look at the Sony a6000, it takes pictures almost as good as a top end professional cameras, in some situations it can be accepted for print publication, it's that good, but it's only $550 so a quarter of the price of the top professional camera, so great pictures interchangeable lenses but some compromises"
398,um yeah actually I think that's a more my type of camera but what are those compromises
398,"first it's a mirrorless camera, so it's a bit like having an extra element in the lens so the light is going to pass through one more thing before it reaches the sensor"
398,If that ever gets dirty of course that dirt may show on your picture
398,"then it has what we call a crop sensor, the sensors not a 35 mil film size, it's actually a three quarter size, the pictures are great, but some blow up to the size of this wall, but at that size at a huge enlargement, you will start to see some of the differences compared to a top end camera"
398,"also it has no bulb mode, so the slowest shutter speed on here is 30 seconds but that's your limit, you can't go to bulb mode and keep it open for an hour or two"
398,I think that's alright for me yeah yeah that's pretty much what I'm going to use it for but how much does it cost again
398,this is only $550 and it comes with a basic lens already dilating to seventy Zoom
398,very good and can I use also other lenses with it
398,"yes there is a wide range of lenses to go with this camera and more being devised all the time, we have a brochure that describes those"
398,oh very good can I have one please
398,sure
398,okay thank you I will take a look at that and then I'll let you know thank you very much for helping me
398,"anytime any questions come in anytime and we'll see you later, have a good afternoon"
399,good morning how's your day?
399,good morning
399,how can I help you?
399,it's going fine so far
399,can I ask what sort of pictures you take?
399,I want to take a look at the cameras here
399,"let me explain the layout of the shop, over here we have the top end cameras professional cameras for $2000, Semi-Pro cameras around about 500 to $600, over here we have social cameras for taking pictures of family and friend basic travel for $68"
399,all kinds of pictures what I just want something simple
399,"it has a 20 megapixel sensor so you'll always get a great picture and they make nice enlargement too, its point-and-shoot and really response so parties, conferences, anywhere you go with people and friends, it's going to be a great handy camera to have"
399,oh yeah I think that's the one I'm looking for
399,"sure pick it up, take some pictures"
399,okay I see it and can I give it a try
399,you can see how light it is well
399,yeah that looks really good you have it in other colors
399,we've also got it in black red pink and purple
399,yeah I think that's fine I am I just came to take a look but I really like this one so I'll think about it and I'll let you know
399,"no problem, please come back anytime, we might have some of the models in as well, but the Nikon is very reliable"
399,you okay thank you very much for your help have a good afternoon
400,hello good morning
400,good morning how can I help?
400,I want to see your new camera the professional one
400,"the Canon 5d Mark 3 has just arrived, it's an excellent camera, please pick it up feel it in your hands"
400,oh yeah actually yeah that's exactly what I was going to try
400,"you can see the ergonomics are being improved, that it sits very naturally in your normal shooting position"
400,yeah it feels very good can I turn it on
400,we haven't got a lens on this at the moment but you can turn it on and have a look through the menu settings
400,do you have any lenses of your own?
400,oh yeah not with me at the moment but it's fine I'll just just came to take a look
400,we can take a lens out and we can attach it to the body if you're like so you can try taking some pictures
400,oh yeah I mean I don't want to bother you too much but that would be very nice
400,"the full weight now around about one half kilograms, it's very solid in the hands"
400,yeah yeah I can to try it actually I was right this is a really good one
400,you can feel how it's being designed to sit naturally in anybody's shooting position that it lands naturally in your hand for whatever work you're trying to do
400,probably the ergonomics is the big improvement over the previous model
400,yeah yeah very much  I am I really like it so I think I'll start saving soon
400,"we have a brochure with the full specifications and our card, if you would like that as well"
400,oh yeah thank you thank you very much you're very helpful thank you
400,no problem and if you have old lenses next time you come in please bring them and we can test them with this camera
400,oh okay thank you very much have a good day
400,thanks your time
401,good afternoon how can I help?
401,hello good afternoon
401,can you show me like you know your cameras the cheapest one
401,"certainly the cheapest  one is  over here, it's only $68"
401,okay yeah that's it you don't have anything cheaper
401,"the cheaper camera than this have all disappeared from the market, they have been priced out by mobile phones"
401,how good is this one
401,"it has a 20 megapixel sensor and the lens is glass, it has a 5 times optical zoom so this means that it will produce a much nicer picture than your mobile phone"
401,actually it's not that it's also a good camera
401,"it's a fantastic camera, beautiful pictures every time, point and shoot, Simplicity, you can really catch the moment"
401,you can see how light it is it's only120 grams
401,yeah that's right and you have it in different colors
401,"we've got it in 5 colors, there is silver that is also black red purple and white"
401,ok and do I have to configure it to try to take pictures
401,"we could set up now so you can just take pictures, but if you want to set up some different things such as Glamour retouching or presets for different environments that's all in the menu system, and we can show you how that works if you want"
401,actually that's alright for now I just wanted to take a look at that I'll keep that in mind
401,no problem
401,anyway thank you very much for your help
402,hello good morning
402,good morning how can I help today?
402,I came to look for a new camera
402,can I ask what sort of pictures you take?
402,oh yeah I mostly take picture close up portraits
402,do you do this professionally or is it a hobby?
402,more like a hobby but I like to have a good hardware for the pictures
402,"we have two cameras at different price points that would do those sort of pictures, that's a full professional model here for $2000 and then you have buy lenses or over here there's a compromise, it will take the pictures you want, and the quality is outstanding, but you don't the full creative control of the top professional camera"
402,it's $550 including the lens
402,I don't know I should have thought about this one but if that one does the job then I can save money then it's better
402,"you can get other lenses for the camera as well, so you can extend its range of possibilities, the compromises are in things like the ISO, it only goes up to 3200, it's a mirrorless so that saves a lot of weight and cost, and the shutter speed only goes up to 30 seconds so it can't shoot Star trails at night time effects so well"
402,oh okay but I am mostly use it for a portrait so that should be fine but can I give it a try
402,"certainly, please pick it up and try taking a few shots, you will notice already compared to the professional camera it's half to weight"
402,yeah I think that works fine I'll have to see the pictures on my computer but I think this one is really good
402,"would you like to try, do you have an SD card on you now, would you like to try taking a couple pictures to take home?"
402,oh yeah I think I'd like to try it
402,okay yeah and I'll see how that looks and then take my decision
402,the high resolution JPEG files so lightroom or any of those software packages should be able to edit it just fine
402,alright well thank you very much for your help today thank you
402,thank you for your time look forward to seeing you again
403,hello good morning
403,good morning how can I help today?
403,I'm just here looking at the new cameras that you have
403,"we have three different kinds of new camera, different price points, we've got the top end professional model $2000 without a lens, we've got a prosumer model that takes really good pictures with a few compromises in the controls $550, and we have the sociable kind of camera out with family and friends for $68"
403,good that one looks really nice can I take a look at it
403,"certainly, it's a very nice, this in your Canon 5d Mark 3 which gives you full creative control"
403,nice and how much is it
403,the camera body is $2000 and lens are extra
403,oh well yeah that's too expensive and do you have cheaper ones
403,"if you like to take nice pictures and have that kind of professional results, this camera is fantastic it's only $550 including the lens but there are some compromises"
403,oh yeah expensive but I think I could afford that
403,you can see already it's only about half a kilo in weight with the lens only
403,yeah actually the weights feels really nice
403,"the standard shutter speed goes up to 30 seconds, the lens range is extremely broad you can get a lens for almost any purpose"
403,what's the sensor size on this one
403,"it's what we call it a three-quarter cropped sensor, so in huge enlargements you will see a quality difference between this camera and the Canon 5d Mark 3, but day to day anything up to around about twenty inches by forty inches you won't see a difference"
403,alright and uh how about the iso setting
403,"this is great up to late evening with an ISO 3200, very low noise in the pictures but as it gets a little bit darker of course of performance drops off"
403,alright I see well I think it's still a good camera but I'll have to think about it a little bit more
403,okay thanks a lot for you time
403,no thank you for your help thank you have a good day
403,have a good afternoon
404,how can I help?
404,uh huh I just want to see the cameras
404,"we have a lot of different kinds of camera, something that respond to the way you like to take pictures, can I ask what sort of pictures you take?"
404,it depends in all kinds of pictures but I'm just looking for a simple one
404,"so pictures of family and friends, that sort of thing, simple travel pictures?"
404,yeah I think pretty much yeah
404,"this is a Nikon Coolpix, it's only $68, it's point-and-shoots takes beautiful pictures with a 20 megapixel sensor"
404,wow Is that a good thing
404,"that's a great thing, a lot of people like the pictures from their mobile phones at the moment, but they are usually 8 to 12 megapixels from a plastic lens, this is 20 megapixels from a Glass lens which is much higher quality"
404,okay oh yeah I see it in the picture it's really beautiful
404,and they go well in enlargement as well and if you've got an HDTV it will look fantastic on those too
404,okay what about the other cameras how much are they
404,"the top end professional camera over here is 2000 dollar, just for the camera body and it gives you full creative control"
404,"over here this is a prosumer camera that takes pictures as good as a professional model, but with some limitations such as Shutter Speed or low light shooting, they're not quite as good"
404,okay but these are still too expensive so I think this is the right one for me this is the best one
404,"this is the best one for good sociable pictures family and friends, it's designed for that to be point and shoot for the fast response"
404,what alright that's very good to know thank you
404,okay thank you please come back anytime if you have more question
404,okay have a good time
405,hello
405,good afternoon how can I help?
405,I'm looking for a new camera actually like a better than my phone
405,can I ask what sort of pictures you take?
405,yeah I like to take some pictures on the move with my friends when we go out and everything
405,"this camera over here is fantastic, it's designed for going out with friends and some basic travel pictures, it's a fun camera that takes beautiful pictures, very Simple"
405,okay is it is it can I carry it everywhere
405,"you can feel the weight, it's only 120 grams and it fits in a pocket"
405,yeah actually that's right it's really light
405,try taking couple pictures if you like
405,okay
405,that looks very good
405,"it comes a lot of all the colors this well, and it connect to an HDTV, you can also make beautiful enlargements, so there a lot of things you can do with this you can upload into Facebook of course, and it's got some glamour effects if you want to play with that sort of thing"
405,yeah actually I like to do that and then what how many megapixels does it have
405,"the sensor is 20 megapixels, so roughly double your mobile phone with a much better lens"
405,is it easy to configure
405,"we have it set up here for point and shoot, so that you can walk out and use it straight away and never think about setting it up again, if you want to, it's very easy to configure it for different environments and for going into the glamour retouch effects"
405,oh ok very well alright can you tell me again how much is it
405,it's only $68
405,oh yeah alright well thank you very much for your help
405,anytime come in anytime if you want to know more about it and we can show you the rest of the range
405,okay thank you have a good day
405,have a good afternoon
406,hi how's it going?
406,it's alright just here to take a look at your new cameras
406,can I ask what sort of pictures you take?
406,oh yeah I actually work at a magazine so I often take pictures of uh exotic areas
406,oh you probably already used to using the Canon 5d Mark 2?
406,oh no actually I have the previous model
406,this is the new Mark 3 please pick it up and feel it in your hands
406,oh yeah it feels the same weight as the old one
406,there's been some work into the ergonomics so you'll actually feel that it's better designed around a range of different shooting positions for the professional
406,and what's the iso setting on this one
406,it goes up to 6400 so great shooting with low noise in low light conditions
406,can I give it a try with my lens
406,did you bring a lens with you today?
406,oh yeah actually I happened to carry one around me
406,we can set that up now and you could  try taking a few pictures
406,we have a focus chart set up over here
406,oh yeah actually I think that I can see the improvement from the old one it's very nice
406,it's the demasking  Facilities can be fully manually controlled and you can see them lowering effect is greatly reduced
406,the picture is very nice
406,good clean results in the different parallel Line section of the chart as well
406,how far does the zoom on this one go
406,"that depends on your full range of lenses, can I ask how many lenses you have?"
406,for the moment just this one but I'll probably get some new ones for this job
406,"they should all be compatible, this is a very friendly camera with the last three models in the range"
406,alright and how much does it cost
406,this camera body is $2000
406,we can put it together as a business package if your magazine is interested in helping out
406,yeah I think I'll see about that and then I'll let you know
406,here's some information to take back to the magazine so they can understand the business package
406,alright very well thank you very much for your help
406,look forward to seeing you again thank you for your time
406,thank you have a good day
409,good afternoon how can I help?
409,I'm looking for a camera but I don't know anything about them
409,can I ask what sort of pictures you take?
409,well family pictures pretty much
409,"we have a few cameras around in the shop, and the way the shop is laid out, these are very Advanced top end professional cameras, here good hobby cameras over there, but great family cameras are over here"
409,I see
409,"this is the Nikon Coolpix so you can set it up so it's just point and shoot, that's very responsive and has really good fast autofocus"
409,you know I think I bought one of these for my daughter few years back different looking
409,"yes they've gone through a lot of development, there's been a lot of competition with mobile phone cameras, so now you can get a really great camera that's quite cheap and is that step above using your mobile phone"
409,like uh data right
409,it's a digital camera so saves a computer file to a chip inside the camera
409,so it can be saved on a computer Library
409,"yes you can transfer things straight to computer and send them straight through to Facebook, you could also plug it into a TV and look at the pictures straight away on the television"
409,I have a smartphone but I'm not smart enough to use it
409,"this camera is designed to be very simple to use, pick it up switch it on pointed and shoot, you always get a good picture every time and it won't freeze if you have an incoming SMS"
409,I don't even know what that is
409,and this is a very simple straightforward camera and give you a great picture every time for only $68
409,that's the part that sounds good
409,is there anything else I can help you with today?
409,no thank you that'll do pretty much made up my mind
409,oh that's great have a good afternoon
409,thank you
411,good afternoon how can I help?
411,well I'm looking for camera
411,can I ask what sort of pictures you take?
411,family pictures babies
411,"we have an excellent family camera over here, this is the Nikon Coolpix, it's a point and shoot camera, it's really rapid in the way it response, it's got great focus so your pictures will be sharp, they always look beautiful"
411,and anybody can use it right children adults imbeciles like me
411,"it's fully automatic, so switch it on, point the camera, press the shutter button and you get a great picture every time"
411,okay what color does it come in
411,we've got this in silver black red purple and white
411,I see
411,what's this glamour retouch effect
411,"if you don't want to know about it, you can just ignore it, but what happens in these days in Facebook and all those Bright Young things, they take a picture and they put stars on it and put smiley faces and make the eyes bigger, this has some of those effects built into the camera"
411,how much does it cost
411,it's only $68
411,that's interesting what's the what are these megapixels
411,"the megapixel tells you how much detail can be captured in the photograph, this has 20 megapixels so you can do a very big enlargement for your wall and it'll have beautiful quality"
411,okay and optical zoom what is this
411,"it's the little switch on the camera, so that it makes this if you're going to close or further from the picture you are taking, like a telephoto lens"
411,how much does it amplify the size of the picture
411,from the widest right down to the most telescopic it's 5X
411,5x manual settings is for what
411,"there's some manual settings that you can do in the camera to get special effects, but if you're not interested in those you can just ignore that option, it's deep in the menus you can't get into that by accident"
411,okay thank you
411,thanks for your time have a great afternoon
412,good afternoon how can I help?
412,I'm interested in buying a camera but I'm not sure what I need
412,let's start the sort of pictures you take and we can match up
412,spontaneous when I feel like it this deserves a picture
412,"travel pictures, family and friends, do you go out and take night pictures?"
412,yeah. And maybe in in parties take picture of people's faces
412,"this camera takes really beautiful pictures as good as a top end camera with some compromises, it's $550, but if you are mostly take social pictures from family and friends maybe you want something smaller, lighter, that's designed for those spontaneous moments"
412,could you show me something
412,"sure, this is a Nikon Coolpix, it's only 68 dollars but that that price is designed to have rapid response to all sorts of social events, so when you go to parties, meeting, sometimes even conventions, people use them for all sorts of things where they are out there people and things happening around them"
412,is it easy to use even after 5 beers
412,"even after six beers, its point and shoot"
412,and it has a flash
412,the Flash's built-in
412,I see and it's automatic right
412,"the way we have it set up here, it's fully automatic point and shoot, it will make all the decisions for you, you just have to think about the photo of the fun you're having"
412,okay so you can give it to anybody and they can take a picture of you
412,yes but make sure they give it back

413,all kinds really in all kinds of weather
413,"this is the top end photojournalism camera, so it's designed to go into space, go to antarctica, go to sea and take any picture that your creative control asks for"
413,can take this under water for example
413,for underwater use it has a special housing
413,I see another option
413,"yes it is, it cost as much as the camera"
413,yes I know
413,so it has all the features a professional would need to take underwater pictures
413,"yes it does, it has full manual settings as well so that you can also affect the white balance, take the shutter speed, you can control your exposure, if you want to go underwater with this camera, it takes brilliant shot, it has a full frame sensor the equivalent of the old 35 mil film"
413,do you have a catalog with the with the diving option box and everything in other options like for underwater lighting and stuff
413,"we have a brochure over here of the accessories, you will find the underwater category is here from page five"
413,may I have this to study at home and look around and compare
413,"certainly you see our business card is on the front, and if you need a special business package, we can negotiate that and organize particular discounts according to how we group products"

414,I'm looking for a camera
414,can I ask what sort of cameras you used before?
414,I'm no good at taking pictures I just have them to show off
414,"I remember those cameras, they were wonderful, can I ask what sort of picture quality you're looking for, do you want something pictures of the kids for the wall, or you want something you can enter in competition?"
414,I'm not competitive person when it comes to pictures or just take pictures oh I have a camera you know
414,how good do you like your pictures to be and do you go out into nature and take that sort picture?
414,the kind of nature I'm thinking of is not something I'd like to discuss
414,we will call that human nature and we have a camera that's perfect for Human Nature
414,I see
414,"this is a fully automatic point-and-shoot camera, so it's sometimes these sorts of cameras get used in photojournalism because it can catch the moment really quickly they are design for parties and going out with friends or going to the beach"
414,yeah that sounds great to me I don't have to worry about the technical stuff
414,"no the camera is fully automatic, so if you don't want to learn the technicalities of the camera that is just fine you focus on your photograph"
414,sounds Good even though if I'm focusing on something else
414,the autofocus features of this camera fantastic so it will pick up mostly what you're looking at through the lens
414,what is the price of it
414,it's only $68
414,now that's good that's sounds really good
414,okay I'll can I look around a little bit more

415,good afternoon how can I help?
415,I want to buy I want to buy a camera but I'm not sure which I need
415,"we have three main kinds of Camera here, there is a sociable camera for going out with friends, to parties,  whole family, to the beach, there is a top end photojournalism camera over there which is Fantastic for going to print publication and entering into International competitions, and over in this corner we have a compromise if you like, it takes fantastic pictures in a really easy way with a reduced price"
415,well if you put it that way I'm really looking for the party camera
415,"and that's it, that's in Nikon Coolpix, it's fantastic, it's autofocus, it's auto everything, all you have to do is pick it up, point and shoot. would you like to try taking a picture with it now?"
415,sure
415,smile
415,beautiful this will work
415,"the picture quality is fantastic too, it has a 20 megapixel sensor which basically means you can do beautiful enlargement"
415,great so no matter how bad the light that can be photoshopped or modified on my computer
415,you can make some adjustments to your pictures with this camera although the format is basically JPEG so if you make too many adjustments the picture quality will get worse instead of better
415,I see I see okay well thank you very much that pretty much settles the deal
415,thank you for a good afternoon
415,thank you
424,good afternoon how can I help?
424,could I have a look at this camera
424,"certainly it's right here, it only weighs 120 grams, the battery is charged you can take some pictures if you like"
424,hm
424,this is one of those new generation digital cameras
424,"yes it is, this is a fairly low end sociable camera to take pictures of family at parties without it being heavy or expensive, it takes beautiful pictures and it's really responsive"
424,I've lost camera so I may be looking for a cheaper type camera
424,this is only $68
424,perfect I'll take it
424,would you like to take a couple pictures with it first?
424,no thank you. Maybe
424,please by all means enjoy on your purchase
424,thank you thank you thank you I will
424,glad to be of service have a good afternoon
425,good afternoon how can I help?
425,well I have a few questions
425,how much is this camera
425,this camera body is $2000 this is without a lens which would cost extra
425,oh my God
425,it's a top end photojournalism camera
425,professional
425,it is absolutely the ultimate professional camera
425,but it's automatic
425,"it can be fully automatic, it can also be fully manual, you decide all the settings yourself, it's quite complex"
425,my brother has a Minolta and he swears by it how does it compare
425,"the Minolta is more like the Sony camera we have over here, it's a quarter the price includes the lens and still takes absolutely beautiful pictures, almost as good as the top end camera but at a fraction of the price"
425,so if if the results of the same as his Minolta which cost a fortune he might say he got a better deal
425,it's very hard to know with digital cameras because prices are dropping every year as models improve
425,what is the price of this one
425,550 dollars
425,oh that is cheap shockingly so
425,"it does take beautiful pictures, it's incredibly light, pick it up see how much it weighs take some pictures if you like"
425,oh that's right we don't use film anymore this is a test memory data
425,"yes, this camera takes the kind of pictures you want to take, from your favorite holidays, it's good to use with people but it's designed to use a with scenery and Landscapes and portraiture, something where you going to try to use a creative instinct but you don't want to fiddle about the complexity the top end cameras"
425,how is it with the salt water is it problematic
425,"it's problematic with old cameras, you need a special housing and they are available"
425,I mean just being in the air the sea and taking picture of somebody jumping off a cliff or something
425,"abnormal precautions apply, don't get it wet be careful of Ocean Spray"
425,just like watches
425,just like watches
425,does it take a movie
425,yes it has a video setting
425,you said the price was
425,550 dollars

429,so you want a good simple camera that will connect to a computer and be simple to use there as well?
429,probably my friends say were you at this in this party as a yes so why didn't you post it on Facebook
429,"this camera here is a perfect Facebook camera, you can click and drag photos straight from the camera after you connect it to the computer in to Facebook, and it it's a little more complicated than doing it from your mobile phone, but with your mobile phone it's a little complicated just to get into the simple things"
429,that's the problem is that I can't use I don't know I'm not my phone smarter than that me
429,"this camera will do what you tell it, and it's fully automatic, so if you want to say to it, I want this picture, I want it to be great, point the camera, press the shutter button, that's what's going to happen"
429,day and night
429,it has a built in Flash so at night time it will automatically decides which side on

431,thousands
431,so I can go on holiday and not worry about capacity until I get home
431,"yes that's right, although if you get a chance to post pictures using a computer while you're traveling, keep people in touch with Facebook it's very easy to do with that as well"

516,"this camera over here takes excellent shots, often they are really good for putting in magazines as well, but it comes at a reasonable price, it's not as flexible as some top end cameras, beautiful pictures"
516,oh I see that's very interesting do you have any other cameras that you can recommend me
516,"we haven't talked in photojournalism camera, it's four times the price of the camera I just showed you, it can do everything creatively you might want to do"
516,okay that's very interesting can you tell me a little bit more of the features that this camera has
516,you'll see it weighs almost a kilogram so already the features are heavily built into the camera
516,yes I notice is very light and stylish
516,"you can take all sorts of different lenses so this kind of cameras going to space as well, in general for regular travel a lot of people find it a bit heavy"
516,okay so which one do you recommend me
516,"I think probably you will really like the pictures out of this one, but you'll find it very easy to travel with as well, you can have one or two lenses and a very simple kit and it's very easy to use"
516,okay so I think I might look into the Sony one and I will get back to you
516,okay thanks for your time
516,thank you for your help and have a great day
516,you too
517,good afternoon how can I help?
517,hi good afternoon I'm looking for a camera that has a high ISO with low noise and this is very important for me
517,"ok this is a top end photojournalism camera over here, you can take all sort of different lenses, has all kinds of creative possibilities, but most important for you it's great in low light"
517,so what is the high ISO performance like
517,"the ISO will go up to 6400, and the noise is very low, it takes beautiful pictures of that level"
517,and what is the sensor size
517,"this is what we call a full-size sensor, so it's quite large, and the numbers correspond through the same numbers when  you used in old film camera"
517,oh that's great I'm looking for a camera that has this type of features
517,pick it up by all means it weighs around about 1 kilo perhaps you'd like to see in your hand
517,oh yes is very light and it feels very comfortable in my hand
517,"it's similar to the old model of the same camera, this is the 5d mark 3, the big improvement over the 5d mark 2 is the way it fits in your hand, the ergonomics"
517,thank you tell me about the ability to adjust the settings
517,"this camera has full manual control, so any creative idea you have, you have full control over it a lot of that gets quite complex, things like white balance iris shutter speed but anything you want to do you can do"
517,oh I think this is the camera I've been looking
517,"perhaps we can set it up later and you can have a use of it, it's quite expensive the body alone is around $2000"
517,okay I see well I might have to talk to my wife first and then I will get back to you
517,when you're coming in and we'll have one set up with the latest so that you can use it then see how it feels
517,ok thank you very much you've been very helpful
517,have a great day
517,"thanks a lot for your time, have a good afternoon"
518,good afternoon how can I help?
518,hi good afternoon I'm looking for a camera for my next trip to Singapore can you help me with that
518,can I ask what sort of pictures you take?
518,will be mainly like family pictures friend of mine is getting married so which one do you recommend
518,so pictures of family and friends and event maybe a few travel pictures?
518,for the most part yes
518,"this camera is incredibly light, pick it up and feeling how light it is, it's only 120 grams and it fits in your pocket"
518,I said this Nikon camera is really light and super stylish do you have any other ones
518,"for what you need to do this is probably the right kind of camera, fine for family and friends in parties, grabbing that picture of the events we want to remember the people"
518,"the other cameras in the shop, it is designed for travel and for high end photojournalist"
518,I see so I think this is the one that I need can you tell me about the features
518,"it's designed to be a basic point and shoot camera, so the way we have it set up here to pick it up turn it on and you just take a picture"
518,I think this one I will fit great for me since I'm not advance you know camera through
518,"if you get interested, there are ways of going through the menu, set up some manual controls that call in some other settings, but generally yes its a very good camera to use straight out of the box"
518,you please show me an example of it
518,please take a picture with it if you like
518,oh I see this is very easy to use
518,yes very and it has a 20 megapixel sensor so you can make some big enlargements if one of those pictures is something you want to see on your wall
518,yeah I think that's one of the pictures that my wife is looking for in a camera so I might consider buying the Nikon camera
518,it's the great camera for everybody in the family to use
518,yes I just need to talk to my wife and see what she says about it and I get back to you
518,no problem we'll see you soon thanks for your time
518,thank you very much and see you later
518,see you
519,good afternoon how can I help?
519,I'm looking for a camera that is stylish affordable and easy to use do you have one of those
519,"depends on what sort of pictures you take, we have two very stylish affordable cameras, one is $68 and one is over $500"
519,oh I see I think I might be looking to get to the one that cost 68 dollars can you please show me
519,"sure, just over here this camera takes beautiful pictures but it's designed to be point-and-shoot, catch that moment with family and friends or when it's an old family holiday"
519,what about the weight this is a lighter is it heavy
519,it's only 120 grams please pick it up and take a picture to see how you feel with it
519,yes you're right is very light
519,"it also has 18 different modes where you can tell it what sort of conditions you are in, just to help me lift the picture quality a little further, if you are at The beach or the snow, it can work out some special settings to make that picture that better"
519,can you please explain me more about the the preset mode
519,"if you go into the menu system you'll see something that comes out that says preset, then it'll say well I want to take a portrait at night time, I am at the beach, I'm in the snow, you tell it what's going on and what you're thinking, and it will choose the perfect setting for exactly what you want"
519,I see so what about the optical zoom
519,"that's five times, so you can do a bit of zooming backwards and forwards without having to run backwards or forwards"
519,and is this one of your latest cameras
519,yes this is the current model
519,I see I think my wife will really like this camera
519,it's a great camera for the whole family and very easy to use
519,is it waterproof
519,"not entirely, if you drop this camera in water it will die, but we have some waterproof accessories here, such a plastic bags you can fit around it so that if you are at the beach it might get wet you can keep it safe"
519,the accessories is very affordable as well
519,okay well I'm going through to see if I the one that fits me and talk to my family and see what they think about the camera
519,no problem is there anything else I can help with today?
519,so far you've been very helpful I will get back to you as soon as I talk to my family thank you very much for your assistance
519,no problem we'll see you again have a good afternoon
519,thank you you too have a great day
520,good afternoon
520,hi good afternoon
520,I'm looking for a camera with very specific pictures
520,"what exactly are you looking for, we should have something that suits"
520,a camera that you take artistic pictures
520,"we have two camera that can take artistic pictures, the Sony has the number of settings but some limits the controls for the shutter speed will go up to 30 seconds but if you want to do very long exposures this camera can't do that"
520,I see can you explain me more about the pictures
520,"this is a lightweight camera designed for travel, it takes beautiful pictures and you can change the lenses on it, but generally speaking there's some compromises, it only weighs half a kilogram as compared to over a kilogram for full manual control camera"
520,and what about the auto focus points
520,it's very good at catching autofocus throughout the picture and when objects are moving it can follow them quite closely
520,I see and what about the ISO
520,"this goes up to 3200 so into late evening you take some really nice pictures, we have a top end manually operated camera over here, that will go into darker conditions for the higher ISO"
520,can you please show me that camera
520,certainly
520,"this is a Canon 5d mark 3, it has full manual control and an ISO of 6400 so it's really good in low light conditions"
520,cool I think this is the one that I've been looking for
520,yes it supposed to research great for travel and yes it does weigh a little bit more than the others but then that's the compromise with full creative control
520,yes I understand and how does how does how much does it weigh
520,1 kilogram if you had a lens that can become another kilogram
520,I see so that might be very heavy what about the sensor size
520,this is a full-frame CMOS sensor which is part of the reason it take such good pictures in low light
520,does it comes with manual settings
520,"all settings can be made manually, many of the settings are preset to be automatic but you can just change that over, so any manual setting you want to try is available"
520,I see and can you please tell me about the long exposure
520,"the standard exposure goes up to 30 seconds, but then it has a bulb mode so you need you can keep the shutter for as long as you want, hours or days"
520,that's very convenient for me I think this is the one that I have been looking for
520,we can set it up in the shop so they tell you to come back and use it to take some test shots with it if you like
520,yes I think I would really like that
520,Saturday morning is a good time for us if you have time to come in then
520,what about saturday in the afternoon
520,if that's fine I'll make sure the camera is ready for you to test it
520,okay then
520,noon yes we will be ready
520,I'll be back here on Saturday in the afternoon
520,great look forward to seeing you again
520,thank you very much and I see you on Sunday
520,thanks your time
520,thank you have a great day
521,good afternoon how can I help?
521,hi good afternoon I'm looking for a camera with very specific settings
521,what sort of things are you interested?
521,this is for my art class so I really need a camera that can fit those
521,are you using a camera in your class now?
521,well I'm looking to buy one to start my art class now
521,"this camera has full manual settings and takes a wide range of lens, can I ask what sort of art you're doing?"
521,well I'm taking a painting pictures of many different artists
521,so you're actually painting and you want a camera you can use to capture things that you will copy from?
521,yes that is correct
521,what kind of scenes?
521,well there many many kinds of it like portraits like picture frames that kind of stuff
521,"I guess it's art class so they'll be taking you through all sorts of different kinds of pictures and most of the different kinds of painting, do you have a budget for this?"
521,well I do have a credit card so I can run while on it
521,this is a top in photojournalism camera and you could go to any lens you need on to this camera so that it will suit any form of artistic photography
521,can you tell me about the weight
521,"in the studio because it weighs one kilogram, if you would have go traveling this plus lenses to be two or three upwards kilograms, so quite heavy to travel with, but excellent work to work with your art with"
521,okay I see and can you please explain me about the ISO
521,"because this camera has a full frame CMOS sensor and ISO 6400 which is quite high, it's great in low light conditions, it'll give you really clear picture in quite low light"
521,nice and what about the manual settings
521,any manual setting you want is available on this camera
521,okay sounds great and lastly I worry about the autofocus
521,"this has 61 autofocus points, and it's a big drop over the last model, what canon have been able to do with fewer autofocus points but better software, it can have better results, it's much more responsive the most of the cameras"
521,and do you have it in white
521,"black only, I am afraid it's a full professional camera"
521,okay I see cuz White is my favorite colors but I might consider getting the black
521,"we do have a camera that takes beautiful shots that is available in white, but it does not have the same easy for manual controls, it does not have the long exposure setting"
521,I see I can you please explain me more about the features on this camera
521,"please pick it up, see how much lighter is than the other camera, you can see it takes great pictures but it doesn't weigh as much, it's designed for travel"
521,yes I can see that well maybe I can buy both of them since I really like you know white so I may have one for my art class and the other one for my trip
521,"I might suggest start with this camera, see how you feel about using it, really does take great pictures and if you're going to copy from them, this might be a good camera to start with"
521,I see and can you explain me more of the features on this camera
521,"it also has great autofocus, so if you are trying to take pictures of people or animals or anything that's going to be moving then it's going to be very responsive to keeping that in focus, it's got a lot of artistic effect built in but I'm not sure if that's useful for you since you will be making your own decisions about those when you do you painting"
521,I see and what about the preset mode
521,it has a range of preset mode so that you can tell it where you are and how you're working and you can make a lot of big decisions automatically for you
521,I see well I think I might start with this camera and see how it works and then I might look into the camera you recommend me before
521,"this is a great camera to start with because it teaches you a lot of the ideas the other cameras you are working with, it's great to have full manual control but this camera gives you a feel for what that can mean"
521,I understand yeah I think this is the one I've been looking for my you know my trips and then I will you know
521,right I'm glad I could help is there anything else I can help you with today?
521,is it possible to come back on the weekend and maybe try the camera before I buy it
521,"we can have it set up for you, just let us know when you're going to come in and we can have a prepared for the lens and a test chart so you can see how it goes maybe bring your laptop in"
521,sounds great let me just look into my agenda and see what time I'm free on the weekend
521,no problem just let us know when you're coming and will be ready for you
521,do you have a card where I can business card where I can contact you
521,certainly I will just attach this with a brochure with the specifications in please
521,very kind for you thank you very much and I'll see you on the weekend
521,thank you look forward to seeing you again have a great afternoon
521,you as well
522,good afternoon how can I help?
522,hi good afternoon I'm looking for a camera for my son just graduated from school and I would like to buy him a new camera
522,Has he taking pictures before or had a camera before?
522,yes he prefers Nikon camera and I'm looking to upgrade his camera
522,so he's used to having this sort of camera for family and friends but maybe want to take better pictures these day?
522,yes he is planning a trip to Costa Rica next month and he really needs a camera with specific features
522,"One of our best cameras for travelers  is over here, it's a Sony a6000, it's quite light because it's designed not to have that mirror and the prism that's so much weight to professional cameras and it still takes beautiful pictures"
522,well my son is not professional he will like a camera with nice setting like autofocus points sensor size those type of things
522,"this is a great camera to start with for a lot of that, you can set these to work when you manual or automatically for travel it's quite light, it will give him some of the ideas about what he might look for a top end camera one day in the future, but for now it's going to take fantastic pictures in Costa Rica, it really is easy to use"
522,ok I see thank you please tell me about the price in December
522,this is around $550 with a basic lens
522,well we think it's a little bit over my budget do you have a camera that is more affordable
522,"the next cheapest camera is similar to the one he has before, it's only 68 dollars, it has some limited manual settings it still takes great pictures"
522,okay I see because the one he had before is already 2 years old so I think this is the newest version of the nikon right
522,"yes this is much the same camera he has been but upgraded, it now has a 20 megapixel sensor other than that it does look the same job taking pictures of family and friends"
522,ok he will he's already familiar with the Nikon camera and since this is the latest one I think this will be great for him
522,"fantastic it's got a few more colors available this year too, and a few extra glamour effect mode, the sort of thing you seen coming through on Facebook you can now do that inside the camera"
522,I see yeah he is he likes to upload his pictures on facebook so what about the megapixels on this camera
522,It has 20 megapixels so you can do some really nice enlargement
522,and what about the optical zoom
522,5 times and it's all set from inside the camera so there are no lenses that you have to change
522,okay I'm sorry if I'm asking too many questions is just that I'm not very familiar with this
522,that's no problem ask all  the questions you need too that's fine
522,great so can you please explain me more about this manual settings
522,"in this camera there is a very limited manual  settings, there's a chance maybe to set the focus, but that's about all, set the focus and adjust exposure, darker a little bit lighter a little bit, if you want manual settings that's a very big jump in price"
522,I see well I think this camera is really good for him so I might thinking to buy this camera for my son next week
522,"yes it sounds like he's already going to have a good clear idea of how to use it, which is important when you're traveling, it's better to think about where you are than how the camera works"
522,yes that is correct and I'm also afraid that he might lose it while he's a traveling
522,I hope not you lose your camera you lose your pictures too
522,yes I am telling him to be very careful on his trip and to take care of this camera I'm going to buy something
522,do you think he'd like to come in and see it first as well just see how it works for him
522,yes I think that is a great option I will ask him which day is free to come and try the camera before buying it
522,Seven days a week so please feel free to call in any time
522,okay so what about on Monday
522,we open at 10 a.m. and we close at 9 p.m.
522,so you free Monday 5 p.m.
522,yes I'm on shift then that's a good time
522,ok I think and then I will be back with my son on Monday at 5 p.m.
522,I look forward to seeing you then have a great afternoon thank you
522,thank you very much for your help and have a great day
523,good afternoon how can I help?
523,good afternoon I just graduated from high school am looking to buy a new camera
523,can I ask what sort of pictures you want to take?
523,this will be pictures from my friends and family
523,going on holidays with the old classmates
523,I'm planning to go on spring break to Cancun this year
523,Fantastic a beautiful place
523,yes it really is that's why we're very excited and that's why I need to buy a new camera for the trip
523,"this camera is designed to take great pictures of family and friends, out on holidays, you got a range of preset modes, so if you're up a mountain along the beach you can tell the camera where you are and it will get the right settings to make a picture look fantastic"
523,that's great since I'm not a professional photographer I think this will fit for me
523,"it can also be said to be straightforward point and shoot so again very easy to use, please pick it up and take a picture with it"
523,oh I see it's very friendly to use
523,and it's designed to work with facebook things like that these days so you can do some of the glamour effects  a lot of people do on their phone that's now available on camera as well
523,okay so I think I can even take some selfie with this camera
523,"always, you will see it's got a flip out screen, turn it around and you can see what your pointing at there, and it's a little bit clumsy maybe, it's not designed to work with a selfie stick the way phone is"
523,what kind of color do you have for this camera
523,its in black white purple pink and blue
523,you have it in green
523,"I'm afraid not, none of our cameras come in green"
523,okay that's my favorite color is green but I also like blue so you have it in blue right
523,Yeah we have it in blue stock right now
523,Can you tell me more about the features
523,"sure, it has a 20 megapixel sensor so you can actually take some great enlargement out of that, it also has a built in optical zoom on backwards and forwards, take a picture and you just zoom in, zoom out a little bit it's something very easy to get used to"
523,very easy to use and can you please tell me about the weight
523,"please pick it up and Put it in your pocket if you like, it's only 120 grams"
523,you're right so I think I do this will be great for my trip
523,Fantastic is there anything else I can help you with today?
523,just like I mentioned I'm not really at a professional photographer sir can you please explain me more about the glamour retouch effects
523,"when you replay your pictures, you can find a special menu in there that gives you some options for whether or not you want to fix red eyes from the flash, change a person skin color, hair color, eye color, give them sunglasses, put kisses on their cheeks, all sort of things you've seen people do in photo booths and on facebook, that's all set through a very simple menu"
523,that sounds like very fine for me I think this is the one
523,yes you can turn everybody green
523,that's going to be fine for my friends and I and what about the price
523,its only $68
523,$68 oh that's very cheap
523,"yes it is, how else can I help you today?"
523,well I'm going to talk to my parents and see what they say and they think about this camera and probably come back tomorrow and try it first
523,Certainly come back tomorrow bring your parents if you like and we'll have it all set up ready to go so you can take some pictures
523,okay are you going to be here so you can I explain my parents about the features and the price of this camera
523,I'm on shift tomorrow from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.
523,well that's great I think I'll be back here after school so I see you tomorrow
523,thanks see you then have a good afternoon
523,thank you very much for your help have a great day
523,thank you
524,good afternoon how can I help?
524,hi good afternoon I'm looking for a camera with very specific about the pictures
524,what features do you need?
524,well I'm a professional photographer so I need a camera that is good in low light and also it has a really iso and is easy to carry around
524,"we have two cameras that would meet the specifications, but one isn't really a professional camera where the other one weighs 1 kilogram"
524,Can you please show me both
524,"certainly, let's start with the high end professional camera, so this camera is designed for photojournalism, and for magazine shoot, it's designed to be printed out of high quality, it's also used for going into space or down into the ocean with appropriate accessories like a spaceship or an underwater housing, it is the best camera on the market today"
524,that's great maybe I can take some pictures well I'm scuba diving
524,"Yes but underwater housing, this is been published in National Geographic before, but remember it does weight kilogram please pick it up see how heavy it is, just for the body and the lens is going to double or triple the weight"
524,I see well I think that the water the weight is not a problem so explain me more about the auto focus points
524,"Certainly, it's got 61 autofocus points and it can follow moving objects very quickly, it's got software in there that respond rapidly, it doesn't need so many autofocus points as other cameras, because it's just working at being able to give you a good accurate answer very quickly"
524,I see and what about this sensor size
524,"it's a full frame CMOS sensor which is part of the reason that the high ISO 6400, the pictures got such low noise they're excellent quality"
524,that's wonderful and what about the manual settings
524,everything can be set manually
524,and you have it in red
524,"it only comes in black, I'm sorry, it is a kind of a one of a kind, it is the top end photo camera available on the market today, so black only I'm afraid"
524,that's ok Black is my second favorite color
524,we can set it up so that you can take some pictures of test chart and if you have lenses at the moment for example it might work with this camera
524,not at this moment but I can ask for a friend to let me lend me his
524,its okay we can set up inside the shop with some of the most common options and you can take some test pictures and see how that goes
524,Oh that'd be great I really want to try it before buying it
524,"just let us know when you're coming in, we need an hour to set up and make sure its on a tripod for the test ready to go for it"
524,okay I am the most important part of what is the price
524,for the body only $2000
524,$2000 wow that seems a little bit expensive
524,"it is a top end professional camera with full manual settings and a high ISO, we do have an alternative that doesn't have such a high ISO and still takes great pictures"
524,can you show me that other camera
524,"certainly, the Sony a6000 has an ISO of 3200, but its shutter speed is limited to 30 seconds so you can't go beyond that point"
524,I see and what about the preset mode
524,this actually has a range of preset mode so that you can use it in automatic settings very easily and still get great results
524,does it have artistic effect mode
524,"Yes it does, whereas a top end camera has none of that, it's designed to take a very straightforward picture, this one you can treat your photos in any way your like almost and put them up on Facebook"
524,I see and what about the long exposure of this camera
524,"only 30 seconds, where a full professional camera has a standard long shutter speed of 30 seconds, where it can be put in the bulb modes so that you can have the shutter open for hours or days"
524,I see and what about the weight
524,"please pick it up and see how light this one is compare to the other one, it's a fraction of the weight only half a kilo"

525,good afternoon how can I help?
525,hi good afternoon I am looking to buy a new camera
525,can I ask what kind of pictures you take?
525,this will be professional pictures
525,Are you traveling or is it photojournalism or artistic kind of the photo?
525,I'll be traveling and also taking artistic photos
525,"ok I'll show you this camera first of all, over here is designed for travel, so the Canon 5d mark 3 allow you to do anything you want creatively"
525,can you explain more about the features
525,"it has a full frame CMOS sensor that will allow you to take pictures in quite low light quite well, with an ISO 6400, also fully interchangeable lenses, and a huge number of lenses available, also full manual settings, anything you want to set manually you can so if you want the shutter open for two continuous days you can do that with this camera"
525,What about the battery life of the camera
525,"This camera will last normally on a normal recharge for around about three hours of continuous shooting, if you're in video mode maybe you need to change your battery every forty minutes"
525,I see on can you please tell me about the auto focus points
525,"compared to other model of camera, it has 61 autofocus points but  fantastic software behind those, so it's got  less data to work with, it can be much more responsive and the accuracy is pinpoint it's fantastic"
525,that's wonderful and what about the weight
525,"please pick it up see how it feels in your hand, it does weigh a full kilogram and if you put the lens on that it's going to be an extra one or two kilograms"
525,I'm worried about the price on this camera
525,just for this camera body is $2000 lens cost extra
525,I see do you have any other options that you can show me
525,"certainly, over here the Sony a6000 is only $550 and please pick it up feel how light it is compared"
525,"It also has a good range of automatic modes, there is some limited manual settings but you can set most of the important things manually that's not a problem, but then it comes in its own with automatic mode where you got a whole range of presets, say I'm at the beach I'm the snow I'm taking taking portrait  at night time or fireworks about 18 of those modes"
525,it sounds like a really nice camera to have
525,"it takes beautiful pictures although not quite as good as a top end professional camera, it's also a fraction of the price and a fraction of the weight, it's designed for travel so that you can take great pictures without it being a burden"
525,how much does it cost this one
525,Only $550
525,That's very affordable
525,yes and we can set it up so you can see it give us an hours notice and you can take some pictures with accuracy charts
525,I won't be able to return in an hour can we try it like another day
525,certainly we are open 7 days a week 10 am to 9pm
525,ok I think I will look into my agenda and see which day I'm free
525,I'll be on shift normally from about 12 until 8 p.m.

526,I will be visiting the most famous places like Kyoto Nara osaka maybe look into the temples
526,Are you traveling with family or friends?
526,I am traveling by myself
526,what you do with your pictures to put them on the internet do you want to print them or enter the competition?
526,for the most part I will upload them
526,"this camera has a 20 megapixel sensor, it's only $68 so you got excellent pictures  great picture quality, quite a low price, it's also extremely simple to use and comes in range of colors"
526,What kind of colors do you have available for this camera
526,its available in black white silver red and pink
526,wonderful white is my favorite color
526,"We have white in stock right now but perhaps you'd like to try taking a picture with it first feel how light it is, it is only 120 grams"
526,yes let me just try it
526,actually I really like that because I have so many luggage for me and I'm looking for a camera that's not too heavy
526,"This is perfect, and also it's design mostly for pictures with people, so if you go to restaurant and you meet new people or you go to a party while you're there, it's a great camera to take for those events too"
526,And what about animals because I am planning to visit Nara visit the deer at Nara park
526,"it has a 5 times optical zoom so depending on how close or how far you are from the deer, it's very easy to frame up a nice picture"
526,I see and can you please tell me about the preset mode
526,"It has 18 preset modes so depending on where you are, you could say I'm in Nara on a great day, or I am on Nagano on the Snowy Mountains, you can just tell it where you are, 18 options and it will choose the best automatic settings for you, the camera is designed for point and shoots so you don't have to think about manual settings"
526,18 options that's great I'm not a professional photographer so can you please explain me about the 18 options this camera has
526,"you can ignore them all if you like, it is designed to point and shoot, it's very simple, those presets is just about telling it when you might be extreme condition, maybe the normal way of thinking is different, on the beach where it's just bright sand and bright Sun, same here in the snow, but choose the best option that suits your normal way of getting around, just leave it there you can ignore it if you like, we can set it up for you in the shop"
526,okay and can you please explain me about the optical zoom
526,"it's a five x optical zoom that's built into the camera, so with one little switch you can make your pictures seem bigger or smaller, zoom in and zoom out on the deer at Nara you are trying to take a picture of"
526,wonderful and can you please repeat me how much does it cost
526,its only $68
526,wow that's very cheap I think I might be able to in to buy this camera
526,"fantastic, is there anything else I can do?"
526,for right now I think I'll be looking into my options and I will get back to you probably tomorrow
526,"I'll be there myself after 11, here is my card"
526,thank you very much I really appreciate it I see you tomorrow then
526,"See you then, have a great afternoon thank you"
526,thank you goodbye
527,good afternoon how can I help?
527,hi good afternoon I'm looking to buy a new camera
527,Have you had a camera before?
527,No this will be the first one
527,what sort of pictures would you like to take?
527,I am not sure can you please show me the camera that you have
527,"Let me explain the layout shop, over here we have high end photojournalism cameras, extremely heavy, extremely expensive, very high creative control"
527,"Over here we have cameras that aren't as flexible, still take pictures that are extremely light and designed for travel, around $550"
527,over here we have cameras at a very good for taking pictures of family and friends and for general travel if you go out on a picnic something like that
527,I'm not a professional photographer I think this camera will be good to me
527,"this is the kind of camera the most people get when they stop taking pictures with their phone, and say I just want one tool for one purpose, please pick it up, see how it feels take a picture if you like"
527,wow that's very easy to use
527,"Yes it's point and shoots, it's designed to be fully automatic, hiding inside are 18 preset modes so if the automatic isn't working quite right, because you are at the beach or somewhere where the light is very different, or a portrait in a forest you can tell it that's your situation and it will still choose great automatic settings for you, so you don't have to think about the camera too much focus on picture"
527,the best option for me since I'm not a professional photographer and worried about the weight of this camera
527,"Pick it up and try putting it in your pocket you'll see it'll go anyway with you, only 120 grams"
527,well just very light I can tell that is very comfortable in my pocket
527,I'm not really sure
527,and 20 megapixel sensor you can take some really nice enlargement out of this
527,I'm not really sure what megapixel means can you please explain to me
527,"yes the bigger the number the higher the resolution, if you want to think about it like that, the picture in the newspaper is low resolution it's got very few dot that make up the picture when you look at, the picture in a National Geographic magazine has a very high resolution so it's got so many dots in the picture that you can't see them anymore you just see a great shot"
527,the more megapixels mean better quality right
527,"yes that's right and it works together with the lens to give you good picture quality, there are mobile phone with 20 megapixels but they only have a small plastic lens"
527,ok I see does this camera comes with a preset mode
527,"yes it's got 18 preset modes so if you're at the beach or up in the mountain, you can say that and it will still choose great automatic settings"
527,wonderful I am the most important thing how much does it cost
527,68 dollars
527,$68 wow that's great
527,Yes and it comes in a range of colors so if you want black or silver or red or white we can do that too
527,maybe I can buy me two too since it's very cheap
527,Yes it's a great camera for the whole family
527,well for myself and another one for my girlfriend
527,"So if  you want to bring her in then she might want to have a look at it too, that's fine"
527,well I wonder if I wanted to be a surprise so I might just try it first and then buy it for both of us
527,We have gift wrapping as well so we'd be happy to do that as well free of charge
527,wonderful which date can I come and try the camera
527,"please take a few pictures now, that's fine, it's all set up ready to go"
527,it's very easy to use and like you said the preset modes are very helpful
527,you also have an optical zoom on this so that you can zoom in and out on your picture in case you can't walk up to get closer to things
527,yes I think this is the perfect camera for bot for me and my girlfriend
527,fantastic is there anything else I can help you today?
527,do you have a business card where I can call you
527,I should give you this earlier and here's a brochure describing a camera as well

527,see you soon then

528,wow that's a lot cheaper than I was expecting
528,"Well they've got a lot competition now for mobile phones, they have to be better and cheaper these days"
528,I see so can you still take a selfie with this camera
528,you see the screen flips out and spins around so that if you hold it on arms length you can frame up a picture and then there's some accessories to make it easier but it's very straightforward just with the camera
528,I see what about the optical zoom
528,"You can zoom in and out of your picture so that instead of walking backwards and forwards to make people look bigger in the frame you can press the lever and the lens move for you, 5 times size"
528,wonderful well I think for the price I might be buying this camera

528,with this camera I think I can take a great pictures
528,"yes it's very responsive so if you take it to parties or wedding something like that, you can zoom in and out on people and it will just press that shutter button and it will react very quickly, there is not much delay in it"
528,I'm worried about the low lights pictures
528,"It has built in flash so generally that flash will go off automatically if you want to take a more artistic picture like a sunset, there is a menu setting to switch the flash off"
528,wonderful I think this is the one I've been looking for

530,good afternoon how can I help?
530,I'm looking for a professional camera
530,can I ask what sort of work you do with your camera?
530,this will be for art school
530,art school so are you in a studio set up or are you going out into the field much?
530,we will be going to the film
530,is weight a big consideration?
530,Yes and no it depends if the cameras it has the features that I need I don't mind the weight
530,is the art school paying?
530,no my parents are paying
530,"okay, this is a top end professional camera, it will do everything you could possibly want to do creatively but the body alone is $2000 and then you have to buy lenses"
530,well it does seems to be a bit expensive do you have any other options
530,"yes over here, this camera still takes great pictures, you can do a lot of creative effects with it, although there are some limits, the whole camera with a standard lens is only $550 so a quarter of the price up front"
530,and can you please explain me about the features of this camera
530,"Sure all the main settings like shutter speed, iso, and iris can be manually set, so you got a lot of creative control, the main limit is shutter speed won't go past 30 seconds so if you want to keep the shutter open for an hour, or a day, or a week, you don't have that option, that's the kind of comprise, but the picture quality is excellent and you can do a lot of artistic photography with this"
530,I see and what about the auto focus points
530,"this is a 179 autofocus point, so it's really good at following moving objects and making sure they stay in sharp crisp focus for you, and while it's doing autofocus it also has a wide range of automatic options, so that it can add automatically exposure for you too, it's got a dozen of presets so you can say I am in a forest, I'm in a mountain, I'm in the snow,  and it will choose the best combination of settings for a great picture every time"
530,wonderful and you mention that is only $550 right
530,Yes that's right pick it up and take a few pictures if you like it weighs half a kilogram with the standard lens
530,yes its a lot lighter than the canon cameras
530,"yes the Canon camera is design for high end photojournalism and going out into high quality print magazines, it's used in a lot of studio, this camera design for travel so its light, it's easy to handle, it will still take great studio shoots but it lacks a lot of that manual controls"
530,this one has all the pictures that I need so are you open until 8 p.m.
530,Yes I am here myself until 8pm and here is my business card and we can find a test chart for you and set up on the tripod so you can actually put it through some places and see how good the test shot looks
530,wonderful let me just go and talk to my parents and see what they say about it and I'll be back before 8 p.m.
530,no problem we'll see you soon thanks your time
530,have a good afternoon
531,good afternoon how can I help?
531,good afternoon I'm looking to buy a new camera just that I'm not a professional photographer so can you please show me the ones you have
531,"over here the high end professional cameras, I don't think you'll be interested in, those over here around $500 that takes great travel photos, outstanding picture quality, over here this camera is designed for family and friends, general travel"
531,yes I think this one will perfectly fit my needs
531,pick it up take a few pictures with it if you like to see how it feels
531,wow it feels very light and also very stylish
531,yes it comes in 5 colors it's available black red this silver white and pink
531,Oh wonderful I think the silver is good for me
531,and also for picture quality is got quite a high resolving power on the sensor so what I mean by that is really good crisp pictures that will make good enlargement on your wall
531,and what about the manual setting
531,"very limited on this camera you can tweak your photos a little bit so that they'll be lighter or darker, you can do some manual focusing but that's all through a menu, the camera is designed be automatic, point and shoot"
531,Oh sounds like it is very easy to use
531,"yes it is and take some more pictures with it, you will see this lever here works the optical zoom, so the number is a five times but you can see just as you zoom backwards and forwards it has a effect on the framing"
531,what about the price how much does it cost
531,it's only $68
531,68 dollars
531,these days they have to do something better and cheaper than the mobile phone so yes the price on this kind of camera is excellent
531,wow I really like the price and I'm going to talk to my parents and see what they say about it
531,Fantastic come back anytime I'll be here most days between 11 and 8 p.m. in the shop is open between 10 and 9
531,most likely I'll be back tomorrow
531,no problem here is my business card
531,thank you very much
531,thank you very much I really appreciate your help have a great day
531,you too thank you for your time
532,good afternoon how can I help?
532,hi good afternoon I'm looking for this is for my art class
532,are you teaching the art class or are you a new student or a current student?
532,I'm a new student
532,is it going to be photography or how are you going to use the photographs for class
532,yes it will be for photography
532,"over here this is a high end photojournalism camera with full manual control, it's used in a lot of creative Studios it works great in low light is has an ISO 6400, so you don't need to invest in a big expensive lighting kit, it also has full manual control over things like shutter speed which can be indefinite you can have an infinite shutter speed"
532,I see and can you tell me more about the features that camera has
532,"if you wanted a camera it's in this camera, pick it up feel how heavy it is, and partly that weight is the mechanic and the componentry that goes into creating a top end camera, if you're just starting at school it might be a little bit much"
532,"this camera has a lot of manual control does fantastic picture, often it won't be used generally for reproduction in high end magazines that sort of thing, but to learn the settings in the camera in way that still gives you great results and for flexible use, pick it up see how light it is"
532,wow it's a lot lighter than the other camera
532,"Even with a standard lens it only weighs half a kilo, it's designed for people who want to travel and get great travel pictures, and to be able to do that it comes to the price is $550 but that's a quarter of the price of the other professional camera"
532,$100 it seems affordable and I like the style of this camera
532,please take a picture of it
532,well I think this one was really nice
532,The shutter speed goes up to 30 seconds and for most of the project your course that should actually be enough
532,yes i think 30 seconds should be enough
532,It has an ISO of 3200 so depending on the night shooting in those circumstances you might find that you will be using the full 30 seconds from time to time
532,and this one doesn't have manual settings
532,"Most manual settings you can manually set your shutter up to 30 seconds but remember it does not have a bulb mode, so you cannot open it up for a minute or two minutes, leave the shutter open, there are other times when you might need to borrow a different kind of camera for different project, but an art school would normally have those"
532,I'm just starting school I think this one will be really helpful for right now
532,"this is a camera that would be great for school and you can use it for everything else you need like pictures with family and friends or if you go on a great oversea holiday, this camera is great for that too"
532,alright well I'm going to talk to my parents and see what they think about the camera and are you going to be here tomorrow 5 p.m.
532,yes I will be here tomorrow between 11 and 2 tomorrow at 5 will be a  great time and here is my business card
532,thank you very much hun I see you then tomorrow

533,yes is very light it is not as heavy as other camera I've been looking

533,Wow it also seems very friendly to use
533,"It's designed to be just point and shoot, it has a number of preset mode so if you're in an exceptional circumstances like the beach or the snow, you can tell the camera that and it can allow for that but generally, just point and shoot"

533,this is the camera that I've been looking for
533,take a few more pictures if you like
533,I think you just convince me I just need to convince my parents now
533,"maybe also mention to them it has the 20 megapixel sensor, which really means that you can take some really nice enlargement so if you get a picture the works really well, it will print up well to put on your wall"

534,wow I also notice it's very light how much does it weigh
534,"It's only 120 grams, it's designed to fit into your pocket not be bulky, just it's going to be there ready to go when you want to take your picture, it's about the pictures trying not to get in the way"
534,I see it seems like a really good option for me and what about the preset modes
534,"the preset modes are something you can use when you're in extreme situations like a bright sunny day on the beach or in the snow, they suggest the camera is a different it might want to work a little different so its like a different kind of automatic mode to deal with the extra light or a particular kind of pictures like portrait"
534,cool well I just talked to my parents and see what they think about the price which I don't think it's gonna be a problem since it's only $50
534,"no problem, glad I could help, anything else I can help you with today?"
534,you're being very helpful right now I will get back to you within the next few days
534,I will be here  between 11 and 7 the next few days he's my business card be great to see you again

534,thank you for your time
535,good afternoon how can I help?
535,I'm looking to buy a new camera and I am looking it to be stylis affordable and easy to use
535,what sort of pictures do you like to take?
535,it will be pictures of my friends my dogs and myself
535,do you travel much?
535,actually I'm planning to travel
535,long holiday are you thinking of taking a different kinds of pictures or  focusing on the holiday experience with friends?
535,for the most part I'm just focusing their holiday experience with friends
535,"this camera is designed to travel around with you and not get in the way while you take great pictures, it's all about the picture and not about the gear, it's point and shoot, fully automatic, although you can go into the menu and do some very limited manual settings just to make sure the picture is top notch"
535,okay I see and how much does it weigh
535,Please pick it up and take some pictures with it
535,wow it's very light I really like this what is the price of this camera
535,It's only $68
535,you see $68
535,Yes 68 dollars
535,that's a lot cheaper than I thought so maybe I will just come back tomorrow talk to my parents and see if they agree with it and get back to you
535,"maybe something else to mention with your parent's it takes beautiful pictures that make great enlargement for the wall so that it doesn't just have to be something you share on Facebook, it could be something you share with them by getting some prints as well"
535,wonderful I'm going on let them know and I will get back to you tomorrow
535,Here is my name card and a brochure with some of the details about the camera look forward to seeing you again
535,thank you very much you've been very helpful
535,thanks your time have a good afternoon
536,good afternoon how can I help?
536,hi good afternoon I'm starting college next semester and I'll be taking at school need a camera that has professional pictures
536,"this camera over here is a fantastic first semi professional camera, it's a quarter of the price of a top end camera with full manual control"
536,Which means is $550 with this normal lens on it pick it up feel the weight
536,so at half a kilogram it's probably a bit heavier than you expected
536,for what I'm going to be at school I think is the perfect weight
536,"it's design for travel photography, so it's got a lot of creative options and a lot of manual control, but down at that price for full creative you are looking at a 2000 dollar camera before you buy a lens, your art school will probably has one of those already"
536,yes they do and since I'm just starting school I think this one will fit my needs
536,please take a few pictures with it
536,"You can see even in here without a flash it works well in fairly low light, it's got an ISO of 3200"
536,you know I noticed it's very easy to use and I think it has all the features that I'm going to be needing
536,"we can set it up if you want to try to take some pictures also like to show you how was the lens works and how well the sensor works, try some of the technicalities we can set that up for you in about an hours time and maybe step you through some of the features of the camera"
536,I really like to try the camera before buying it
536,"fantastic can you come back in one hour, we'll have a set up on the tripod of the test chart"
536,yes I will come back in an hour and see if it's what I'm looking for
536,We'll be ready for you then meanwhile here's my name come out let us know if you can't make it again later today and we can organise a different time

537,hi good afternoon I'm looking to buy a new camera that is easy to use affordable and stylish
537,and what sort of picture do you like to take?
537,for the most it will be pictures from my family and friends
537,so you looking for the next step up from a mobile phone?
537,yes that is correct
537,"This camera is designed for exactly that purpose, it's great for family and friends but it takes lots better pictures than a mobile phone and it works much more quickly, point and shoot you take a picture straight away instead of that irritating lag you get with a mobile phone"
537,wonderful and what about the weight
537,pick it up and take some shots with it
537,well it's really easy to use and light
537,"it's only 120 grams and it also has 20 megapixel sensor which is a fancy way of saying the pictures are fantastic quality and you could do so great print from it, it's not just for facebook and the internet"
537,and do you have it in black
537,we do
537,and what is the price of this camera
537,its only $68
537,$680 very cheap
537,Yes it's competition against mobile phones so that's been fantastic for cameras it means you got great quality at great price these days
537,I see well let me just talk to my parents and see what they think about it and I'll be back tomorrow morning
537,no problem here is my card and some information about the camera
537,thank you very much to be really helpful have a great day
537,no worries look forward to seeing you again have a good afternoon
538,hi good afternoon I'm looking to buy a new camera and I just needed to be a portable and easy to use
538,can I ask what sort of pictures you take?
538,it will be pictures for my family and friends
538,"this camera over here is fantastic for that, it's a next step along after mobile phone cameras, so its just like to be with you all the time but nobody's going to ring you in the middle of trying to take a picture, please pick it up and see how it goes"
538,This lever here is the optical zoom so if you push it one way or the other just see how that goes
538,wow that's really nice to you
538,"yes it's point and shoot and you can see the great picture quality there, just if you open up one of the pictures there and zoom in, you can see it come up beautifully and would make a lovely print as well"
538,and how much does it weight
538,it's only 120 grams it fits in a pocket
538,wow that's wonderful and do you have it in black
538,yes we do
538,great and finally what is the price
538,It's only 68 dollars
538,You say 68 dollars
538,Yes 68 dollars
538,wow that's really affordable I was just talked to my parents and see what they think about it and I will get back to you
538,I'm here for the next 5 days between 11 a.m. and 8 p.m. and the shops are open between 10 a.m. and 9 p.m. 7 days a week so I'd be happy to help you again but somebody else will be here
538,thank you very much for your assistance and have a great day
538,you too thank you for your time
538,see you then
539,good afternoon how can I help?
539,I'm looking to buy a professional camera since I'm starting a class next week
539,so you're starting art class have you work in photography before?
539,I haven't work at Photography before but I am starting a class next week
539,Over here we have a top end professional models with full creative control the body alone is $2000 and weighs 1 kilogram
539,since my parents are paying for it I might look into an option that is more affordable
539,"over here we have a camera that has a lot of creative control, it's design for travel photography, so a lot of the things like a bulb setting are not included in this camera, but it still got a lot of manual control, a lot of artistic control, it's a great camera to teach you the concept and get a great picture as well"
539,it sounds like it has the features I need since at our school they have professional cameras and I just need one for my practice
539,"this is $550 and you'll be up in manually set the shutter speed which is something I think the school ask you to do, you can also use a manual lens on it so you can manual set your aperture, I guess the school will step through those things, this is a very popular model with art students"
539,wonderful and what about the weight
539,please pick it up and take some pictures weighs around half a kilogram
539,I see its not that heavy
539,"No it's actually mirrorless, its gotten rid of a lot of the mechanics that are in some of the larger cameras, that cause some compromise in terms of creative control but that means it's really light and you can go with it and take great pictures without it being a problem"
539,and you mentioned that it's only $550 right
539,550 dollars
539,and do you have it in black
539,yes we do
539,I'm just going to talk to my parents and see what they think about it and I'll get back to you
539,"Here is some information that you might want show them, it talks also more about the details with the camera, what's possible, and here is my name card, it would be a pleasure to work with you again and step through the features of the camera"
539,wonderful so most likely I'll be back here tomorrow
539,I'll be on shift after 11 a.m.
539,thank you you been very helpful
539,you have a good afternoon
542,good afternoon how can I help?
542,I'm fine how are you
542,I'm great thanks I enjoy working its a really good place to be
542,I was looking for a camera just to take good pictures what do you recommend
542,they all take great pictures
542,can I ask what sort of pictures you take?
542,mmm just any picture
542,"let's have a look over here, I'll explain the layout of the shop as well, this camera is maybe the first and after the mobile phone, it's fantastic for family and friends, it's got a 20 megapixel sensor which means that you get some nice prints out of it as well"
542,"Over here is our top end photojournalism camera, that body alone weighs 1 kilogram and cost $2000, then you have to buy a lens"
542,"over here this camera is around $500, it takes beautiful pictures and it's designed to take travel shots, it's quite light, pick it up feel how light it is, it's about 500 grams"
542,let's see
542,the pictures it takes are almost as good as a photojournalism camera
542,but if you're focus on family and friends this is only $68
542,Wow cheap
542,"mobile phones are the real competition now, so camera makers have to good cameras, take great pictures, do it easily, and they have to make a cheap"
542,pick it up and try taking a few pictures
542,ok
542,It's only 120 grams
542,that's okay
542,"let's have a look at the picture you took just then, so if you bring it up on the screen you can zoom in there, and you can see its got quite a lot of detail"
542,the picture looks ok
542,"it's a big step up to the qualities I said, this is $68, it's better than your phone, to get much better than, $550 so almost ten times more"
542,I think too much
542,"for this one everything's automatic, point-and-shoot, family and friends, you don't get that irritating lag you get with your phone, just point and shoot and go"
542,I might have to think about it but maybe I'll buy it
542,"Probably take your time, this is a brochure detailing is what the camera is capable of and my name card, I'm on shift between 11 and 7 p.m. each day"
542,ok thank you very much for your time
542,Thanks for your time have a great afternoon
543,excuse me how much does this camera cost
543,"good afternoon, this particular camera is designed for travel pictures, it's really quite lightweight, takes great pictures $550"
543,wow what about the auto focus points how good is it
543,"its got 179 points right across the sensor, its measuring all the time what changes are happening in your picture, it will choose what it thinks subject is, it will adapt, really responsive"
543,wow what about the weigh how how heavy is it
543,"pick it up and take some pictures, it's half a kilo"
543,Wow pretty lights
543,can I ask what sort of pictures you take?
543,I take pictures for a photo company
543,Is this a business camera you are looking to invest in your or personal camera to go out for travel?
543,yes
543,a business camera
543,yes
543,"Over here we have the full professional model, I think you might know the old Canon 5d mark 2"
543,oh yes yes I remember that
543,"This is the Canon 5d mark 3, so pick it up and you'll see the body alone weighs a kilo"
543,wow this is nice
543,"the big change since the 5d mark 2 is the ergonomics for how it fits in your hand, so it's really been designed from that point of view now, they had it pretty right for this time around"
543,what about the manual settings can I adjust it
543,"you can adjust everything, this camera can be fully automatic, full manual, this is a camera that's gone to space and going into the ocean, if you want to do it this camera can do it"
543,I like this camera how much does it cost
543,are you paying this for yourself so is the company buying it?
543,myself
543,"ok, the camera body here is $2000, if you have some old Canon lenses, anything under about ten years will work with this camera body"
543,what about the color do you have black
543,only
543,hmmm I think I should buy this
543,"we can set one up for you with a lens for you to test against a test chart and maybe you could bring your laptop in and see how it works with your software, that sort of thing, really is some time for that, but this is my business card if you want to come in"
543,maybe tomorrow is OK
543,you have one set up with the test shot ready for you to test out tomorrow you can spend an hour with the camera if you want
543,yes thank you very much for your help
543,no problem look forward to seeing it tomorrow
543,see you tomorrow
543,bye
544,good afternoon how can I help?
544,I'm doing ok just browsing around
544,"Let me explain the layout of the shop that might help you a bit, in this corner we have family and friends photos, basically the low-end cameras take great pictures but no fancy bells whistles, over here we have moderately expensive cameras, they are designed for travel, they take great pictures, some compromises but almost as good as the top end cameras, over here which started $2000 just for the body and you can do anything with that camera, so if you want to browse look around the category of your interest, you can check or anything, I'll be over here you got any questions"
544,ok thank you for your help
544,no problem
544,feel free to pick the camera please take some pictures if you like
544,let's see
544,"For the picture quality It's a very light camera, this one is designed without all that the heavy glass inside the body, it's a mirrorless"
544,not quite sure at this the camera I will like
544,"what about the photo, can I ask what sort of photos you take?"
544,uh just everyday pictures that's it nothing special
544,"family and friends, beach, picnic?"
544,kind of sort of just maybe a little little bit high quality a little bit just normal pictures
544,do you take many pictures with your mobile phone?
544,sometimes sometimes
544,are you happy with the results?
544,just a little bit just a little bit
544,just a little bit better would be a big step forward
544,I'm not sure yet I'm not sure
544,"Well You taken some pictures with this, feel free to bring your laptop, you can take some pictures with this and transfer them and see how they look on the screen that's more familiar to you, but I will show you this other cameras as well"
544,"That camera is designed for travel to take fantastic pictures on a budget, but still really great almost top end pictures, this camera is the next step up from your mobile phone, it's got a optical instead of a digital zoom, so the pictures always have consistently good quality as a 20 megapixel sensor so you can get some nice prints, its only $68"
544,I have spec sheets on both cameras
544,and here is my name card
544,thank you I think that's it for today I'll maybe stop by tomorrow thank you for your help
544,no problem anytime have a good afternoon
544,you too
545,do you know how many colors this camera has
545,"This is a full professional camera, it only comes in black"
545,hmmm I see
545,"It's used for top end photo shoots that sort of thing, it's been to space, it's been to the depths of the ocean, whatever you need to do with a camera you can do with this camera, body alone is $2000"
545,very expensive
545,Only the best
545,pick it up and see how it feels in your hands
545,ok
545,it weighs a full kilogram
545,depending on the lens you buy the double or triple
545,can I ask what sort of pictures you take?
545,just a few pictures here and there and just I don't know just I just take pictures
545,"Family and friends go to the beach, you don't go out of your way to be terribly creative in a sense"
545,pretty much pretty much pretty much
545,i am surprise you admitted that one
545,"this camera is designed for family and friends, the fun you have it will still take some great travel pictures, the pics you take one won't appear in top end glossy magazines unless they're really newsworthy, but it'll make some great enlargement for your wall as well, and with new HDTV this come up really well"
545,do you know the price for this
545,It's only $68
545,Wow super cheap
545,compare to $2000 and no lens
545,it's the right tool for the for the right job you might say
545,I think this is not too bad
545,"pick it up and take some pictures with it, please"
545,ok
545,"Here is the optical zoom so if you flick that one way or the other, you can see the difference it makes on your framing"
545,ok let me check it out
545,I think this is ok but maybe I check another store out
545,"no problem, you'll find a lot of different brands have similar cameras, a lot of shops will have the same camera too, it's a very popular automatic point-and-shoot, it's all about the picture not about the camera, here is a brochure and my name card, please come back anytime"
545,thank you very much for your time I'll see you again hopefully
545,Have a great afternoon thanks for time
545,you too thank you
546,do you know what is the sensor size for this camera
546,"this is a full-frame CMOS sensor, so it's basically the same size as the old frame of 35 film you might remember"
546,ok now I remember
546,that with the high iso means it's really good in low light
546,do you know about the long exposure rate
546,"the standard shutter speed goes up to 30 seconds with this camera, but it has a bulb so you can switch to that and keep the shutter open for as long as you like an hour, a week, a year"
546,ok do you know how much does it cost
546,"the body alone is $2000, lens are extra, please pick up the body hold it in your hands, you will see how the ergonomics have change for the cameras, it weighs a full kilo"
546,let me see
546,interesting
546,"it has full manual controls so anything you want to do creatively you can do, so even some of the more obscure settings like histograms, color balances end white balances can be set manually"
546,maybe did you have a another camera you recommend
546,what sort of pictures do you like to take?
546,I like to take professional photography
546,this is something you make money at or you are trying to take the best that you can in competition?
546,I'm just looking at taking good pictures for a like weddings are for friends just I guess composites is for them
546,"Hm that's tough, most wedding photographers would normally go with this camera over here, but you're not looking at making money as a wedding photographer?"
546,not yet but just just to start off
546,"this camera has a lot of control, the shutter speed only goes up to 30 seconds but if you're doing wedding so I guess you don't want more than one second really in practice, and you can attach a flash with this and correspond to the flash quite well, you can manually set most things except for those more obscure setting like white balance, histogram, it's a good camera to learn the concepts and get some great pictures out"
546,what about the artistic effect mode how does that work
546,"It's in the menu setting, and there are a dozen artistic effects you're probably familiar with from your mobile phone, picking up some of those ideas and putting them into a camera body"
546,what about the iso rate how long is that
546,"this is a got a very sensitive sensors, it's around 3200 ISO which were the 30 second shutter speed gives you a lot of creative control but just not as much as a camera that cost four times more"
546,interesting do you know what colors do you have in this one
546,we have black and white and silver
546,maybe
546,"pick it up and take some pictures with it, please"
546,ok
546,"do you work with photos on a laptop or through a TV screen, do you like to print them?"
546,I work on them on the laptop
546,"If you like, you can take some photos here, bring your laptop in and transfer them over and see how well that works for you"
546,okay maybe I'll think about this camera and I'll let you know tomorrow
546,Here is a specs sheet and my name card
546,thank you very much for your time
546,have a good afternoon
546,thank you
547,good afternoon how can I help
547,I'm just browsing just trying to see what camera is the best for just taking pictures and just showing to my friends
547,"okay I'll describe the layout of the shop too, over there we've got the top end photojournalist cameras, for that camera body weighs 1 kilogram it cost you though, over here this camera is designed to take pictures almost as good as that camera for $550, it's designed for lightweight travel, expeditions"
547,"Over here the Nikon is like the next step up for a mobile from a really good mobile phone camera, takes much better pictures, it's got very little manual control, it's a little bit not flexibility and it's designed to be automatic just point and shoot"
547,what about the present mode what is that
547,"Because it's fully automatic sometimes gets a little bit confused in extreme situations, so if you're in a really dark forest or if you're on top of a snow-covered mountain, they are exceptional, so you need to tell that something strange is going on, that will help the automatic mode work in your favor"
547,what it what is mega pixels
547,"the bigger the number the better the picture that comes out, this is a 20 megapixel camera, some mobile phones say that 20 megapixels as well, but they only have a small plastic lens, this has a medium-size glass lens and that's like your eye in front of the sensor so that's very important"
547,you can get some nice enlargement and have some nice prints for your wall for this camera
547,okay maybe I'm not sure yet maybe I just brought a little bit longer
547,"These two cameras are set up so you can take some pictures while you're here if you like, if you want to play with the large photojournalism camera, we would have to set that up and need an hour notice if you do that, please look around if you have any other questions I will just be over here"
547,ok thank you
547,excuse me do you know what is the sensor size
547,"Sensor size is the size of the computer chip in the back of the camera that picks up the image from the lens, so the bigger the sensor, the bigger the area, the better quality the picture, it has a three-quarter sensor which it's an old fashioned measurement, it's quite large, it's about five times, six times each dimension compared to your old mobile phone"
547,sounds pretty good
547,"it's lightweight expedition camera, so unless you want to take extreme closeups with huge telephoto lenses with lions and tigers and bears, oh this is a great camera to take traveling"
547,maybe I like this one but I don't know yet maybe maybe I'll talk to my family and see if they want to come in help me search but thank you for your time
547,"please take this brochure with you if you're interested in this camera, this something that they can read with you and work through, this is my business card as well come in anytime between 11 and 7 p.m. Friday and Wednesday"
547,thank you for your time
547,thank you i look forward to seeing you again
547,okay see you soon
548,good afternoon
548,I was trying to find out the auto focus points
548,On the Canon 5d mark 3?
548,yes I wanted to know how many points does it have
548,"it has 61 autofocus points, a lot of other cameras have autofocus points between hundred and two hundred, what Canon have done with this new version of the 5d is that for they reduce the number of autofocus points, and it's much more responsive"
548,ok what about the weigt is it too big or too late
548,pick it up and see
548,ok
548,it weighs a full kilogram
548,not too bad
548,have you use the Canon 5d mark 3?
548,unfortunately once but not really
548,did you normally work with Canon or Nikon camera?
548,The first time I used a Nikon but I'm slowly moving onto the canon
548,hey you looking at this for business use or?
548,mostly business but I work for a company so maybe personal use
548,"So sort of a hybrid use, can I ask what sort of with all the pictures you take?"
548,I take high end fashion photography
548,So it gets very complicated with tax and who pays
548,yes indeed yes indeed
548,do you do most of your work in studio or in the field?
548,both actually both
548,"It's very adaptable camera for both, it's more of the tripod that you want to change between the two settings, if you have access to any of the lenses any kind lens under ten years old should work with this camera"
548,no but my friend has some extra lens that he can let me borrow so
548,would that be a regular thing?
548,maybe a one off being
548,"We have to look at selling you some lenses as well maybe, do you have two or three or four favorite lenses ?"
548,not yet but slowly getting it
548,"So what we might need to do is set up the camera with the maybe the five to six main lenses in the range of work that you might do, and we have a set up here when you can come in, work with the camera shoot the shots against this test chart, and we had a range of lenses so you can think what works best for you and how"
548,okay sounds interesting but what about the price how much is the canon or
548,"this body is $2000, the lenses, some of them cheaper than the body some of the $200000, it really did I don't think this lens in fashion normally"
548,let's see
548,I think maybe I would like this one
548,"is there a time when you can come in to give us with a bit of notice to set up on a tripod, set up with a test chart, maybe select some lenses"
548,I will say maybe next week but what is how many colors do you have in this canon
548,it's a top end professional camera so what you see is what you get
548,okay so I think next week is fine with me if that's okay with you
548,"Yes we will have one set up, it's Tuesday so good day for you"
548,I'll check my schedule but most likely I should be free on Tuesday
548,"Here is my business card that has my phone number and email address, just let me know when you're coming in so we can be prepared for you and bring in your laptop in of course, we can then connect it up and see how it works with your software"
548,okay that works for me ok thank you very much for your time I'll see you next to
548,I look forward to it
548,thank you very much
548,see you soon
549,good afternoon how can i help?
549,just browsing but just looking for a camera for my friends birthday
549,"Do you know what your friend likes to do with cameras, do they just like to take happy pictures with friends or family, or you're shopping around for a fashion photographer?"
549,mmm just friends and family type pictures
549,"just explaining the layout of the shop, that's high and professional gear, down there is high end prosumer gear, so great pictures, kind of quite cheap at $550, this is a family and friends kind of camera amazing value at $68"
549,$68 well cheap
549,"it's designed to be the next step up from your mobile phone camera, so it's a real camera, takes your pictures, doesn't have that time lag that you get for your mobile phone, handles like a camera instead of like something you might drop in the river and then freak out"
549,yeah definitely true that's very true
549,picture quality is a lot better than the mobile phone but obviously not the same classes these cameras that are designed to be printed in glossy magazines
549,I definitely true and that's true maybe can you tell me about the megapixels
549,"It has 20 megapixels and I know a lot of mobile phones make the same claim, the big difference here's the lens, so think of the lens is the main eye of the camera, it's much much bigger than your mobile phone, so the picture quality on the 20 megapixels is so much better, you get some really nice enlargement out of this"
549,ok lets see because I don't know too much but just trying to find a cheap gift for my friend so
549,"if he like to take pictures his family and friends, this is point and shoot fully automatically, we can go through all the menus with you here to make sure it's absolutely certain, it's simple operation"
549,ok maybe can I bring my laptop in come check some of the photos are on my laptop and if I like it I will like to purchase it
549,"Of course that's a fantastic idea, just try taking some pictures now so you get the feel of the camera"
549,ok
549,you can see it's only 120 grams
549,wow this is very light I think that my friend really like this camera
549,"It's designed to go with people wherever they go, it's all about the picture with this camera, it's designed so that you don't have to think it out"
549,I'm very interested now so maybe maybe later on after dinner I will come back and check it out
549,"come back anytime if you got your laptop, this camera is charged up ready to go, anytime we are open between 10 a.m. and 9pm"
549,perfect okay I'll see you later on tonight then thank you
549,no problem look forward to seeing you again
549,alright thank you
550,excuse me do you know about the long exposure rate for this camera
550,"Yes the standard shutter speeds on this go up to 30 seconds, that is your limit"
550,I can't because I'm looking for a good camera for my friend who's a photographer but he really doesn't out too much about cameras but he's trying to get into photography a lot so he wants a high end
550,"to give you an idea, the high end camera over here we will start looking at that, it's $2000 just for camera body then you have to buy lenses which can be much more again, and pick it up feel how heavy it is"
550,ok well very very light
550,it weighs a kilogram
550,whole
550,"so it feels great in your hands, takes fantastic pictures, this is the camera the fashion photographers would use for glossy magazines so incredibly expensive but full manual"
550,interesting ok
550,"but if your friends just starting out, for a quarter the price we have a camera that will take pictures almost as good, feel it how light it is it's only 470 grams"
550,let's see
550,"The picture quality is fantastic and you have a lot of control over manual settings, so if you are learning photography, you're learning the ideas,  you can put the ideas into practice here before you make the decision on what camera you want next"
550,ok how much is this camera cost again
550,550 dollars
550,ok
550,"if your friends interested in photography and wants to learn to shutter speed, this is good beginning camera"
550,ok what about the long exposure rate how good is that
550,"This Is limited to 30 seconds, with the full professional model you can going to a thing called bulb mode, where you can keep the shutter open for a minutes, a week, a year, for as long as you for your  creative purpose"
550,with this one nothing over 30 seconds
550,what colors do you have in this
550,you can see we have silver on display
550,we also have black and white in the back room
550,ok cuz my friend really like silver so
550,feel free to take some picture with it if you like
550,ok let me test it out for my friend
550,Is it a surprise or you want your friends have a look it up to us as well?
550,I think I like it but I don't know if my friend like it so maybe I have to call them and ask them for to come with me and see if he likes it too so
550,"here is a brochure my name card so if you want to take him out for a coffee or something get something to start talking about before you come and see it, and I will get you a head in, maybe we can set it up here and you could take some test shot on our test chart"
550,ok ok so I'll let you know then and I'll be back soon then thank you for your help
550,always a pleasure have a good afternoon
550,you too
551,good afternoon how can I help?
551,just browsing but I just really want a real really expensive camera just to take pictures
551,what sort of pictures do you like?
551,just any pictures but I just want a high quality camera just because
551,you want the best
551,yeah that'll work that'll work
551,"we have two cameras the people would call the best, this one, pick it up feel the weight, the camera body is one kilogram in weight, so how does it feel to you is it ok is it too heavy?"
551,it's very light very light
551,It's a full kilogram
551,ok how much is it
551,"this camera body is $2000 and then lenses would be extra, so that would double triple the price of the cameras, if you've had a Canon before, any older lens should work on this camera up to about ten years old"
551,what is the what is the sensor size
551,This is a full frame CMOS sensor so it's as big as the sensor get in  these regular DSLR's
551,okay I don't really know too much about cameras but just want a real pricey camera so
551,this is the most expensive camera we have
551,okay can I see another camera
551,afraid it will be less expensive
551,"this camera is designed to take pictures almost as good as that camera at one quarter of the price, pick it up and take a few pictures if you like"
551,ok
551,you can see it's about a third the weight
551,"It's designed for expedition , for people who go on long travel journeys who like to take great travel pictures but who can't afford to carry the weight of the bulk of the other cameras, so this way it's quite a professional camera for very focus on travel"
551,how much is this
551,afraid it's only $550
551,only 550
551,it has a range of interchangeable lenses so we can maybe increase the price by adding some lenses
551,ok is this camera really nice
551,"This is one of the most stylish cameras in the field, if you go out with this people will appreciate that you recognize what you're doing, then that you have a strong professional eye"
551,maybe I like the canon
551,"Both of the best camera for their purpose, the canon is designed for creative control in any environment, this is cameras focused on travel to exotic places"
551,that's a tough decision
551,Let's look at the canon again
551,"please feel it in your hands and see how the ergonomic works, you can see how that's one of the advances of the 5d mark 2 is the sculptic of the body"
551,ok you I think I'll buy this camera just because I just want something
551,"here's my name card and we will organize for delivery, does it need to be gift wrapped?"
551,no not really I'll take it as it is
551,ok it'll be ready tomorrow at 10 a.m.
551,perfect thank you very much
551,always a pleasure and we will have a range of lenses for you to choose from that as well
551,ok thank you very much
551,thank you for your time I'll see you tomorrow
551,ok see you
552,good afternoon how can I help?
552,I'm looking for a high quality camera for for myself for business
552,can I ask what line of business?
552,I'm still trying to figure out right now but just really want to take high quality pictures
552,what sort of camera did you have before?
552,no camera
552,so you looking for a professional future in photography but you're also trying to get together some of the technical ideas as well
552,Yes exactly
552,"This particular model here is very popular with art college student, its only $550 but the quality of the pictures almost as good as a high end photojournalism camera, it has a range of interchangeable lenses, a lot of manual settings, so you can work on full automatic if you want, but you  can drop into all the mainstream manual settings and play with those as well as you develop a sense of how the technicalities work"
552,okay let's see what about the artistic effect mode is it really good or is it ok
552,can I ask what software you use?
552,I'm not too sure yet
552,"that's okay, this software that's package with this camera is quite effective, and I would say for most of our buyers they do that in the computer, if you want to share photos from this straight into Facebook with some artistic effects, then you have that option, and it's similar to the range of the effects you have on your mobile phone"
552,hmmm okay so what about the long exposure rate is it is there I don't know is it ok
552,"the standard exposure runs up to 30 seconds, on this camera that's is the limit, a lot of cameras have a bulb mode where you can keep the shutter open for a minute, a week, a year, but that quadruples the price"
552,what about the weight is it light or is it heavy
552,"It's 500 grams please pick it up take some pictures, have a play"
552,ok
552,it's not bad not bad
552,"you will see in the menu setting here where you can set it to manual mode and if you have a manual lens, and manual focus"
552,do you think this camera very good for my business or do you recommend another camera
552,"So far as your business is developing, this is probably the right point to start with, if you need one of these larger cameras, we have a higher facility, so you can come in here, and play with the camera anytime you want to take it out to the field we can hire a camera for two or three days"
552,ok let's see the Sony first and we'll take it from there
552,"It will be in stock for you tomorrow, if you want to come in and pick it up then, for now here is a spec sheet so that you can reread what's happening, and my business card"
552,thank you so much for your time thank you
552,have a good afternoon
552,alright
552,ok you too
553,good afternoon how can I help?
553,hey um I wanted to buy the most expensive camera you have
553,"That's this one, how much would you like to spend?"
553,it doesn't matter
553,"this camera body is $2000 and we have an excellent long range zoom lens that goes from 10 millimeters to 250 millimeters, and that's another $7000"
553,ok can you tell me about the name of the sensor size
553,"it has a full frame CMOS sensor which is the standard by which all others are judged, that is the gold standard of digital SLR"
553,ok also the iso rate
553,"the iso on this goes up to 6400 so you can take good pictures in low light, very little noise, very crisp effect"
553,ok ok is this really the top of the line camera
553,"Yes it is, this is a camera that's gone to space ,to the depths of the ocean, this camera is used for a high end research applications, the camera body itself is top end, then the lens you can buy a range of lenses, we have some more consumer lens that can go with it, we also have a very good range of upper professional lenses"
553,ok um do you have another camera by chance or
553,"Over here we have cameras to take pictures almost as good as this camera, but its only $550, the lenses are all within a prosumer range, so they're all high end hobby lenses, they are not professional, over here this camera is designed to pick up the idea of your mobile phone, it's point and shoot, it's great with family and friends, it's 68"
553,I think it's too cheap for
553,with the Canon we can put together a $9000 package
553,ok ok let me check my schedule and I can come in next week
553,"the camera will be ready then, and we'll have the lens I mentioned, we will also have two or three others you might be interested"
553,okay I'll see you next week
553,thank you for your business here is my card
553,thank you very much
553,I am afraid it's only available in black
553,okay that'll work thank you very much
553,no problem have a good afternoon
553,thank you see you again
553,see you next week
553,ok
554,excuse me do you know if this camera is very good on megapixels
554,"it has a 20 megapixel sensor, so it takes pretty high resolution pictures, they look really good in enlargement, and I know some mobile phones also have 20 megapixel sensor this but this is a great lens in front of it as well, so the pictures a lot cleaner and the colors a lot brighter"
554,ok I'm actually looking for a high quality camera but not too expensive and not too cheap do you have one
554,"we have a few cameras in that range, but can I ask what sort of pictures you take?"
554,I'm trying to take pictures for a local newspaper
554,"oh so not a high-end glossy magazine, so the Sony a6000 is actually really great camera for only $550, the pictures are almost as good as a top end professional camera, but there are some compromises, the shutter speed only goes up to 30 seconds, you don't have a bulb mode so we can't go past that"
554,ok ok sounds pretty good what a problem the sensor size is it OK or is it little I don't know
554,"It has a good standard three-quarter sensor, don't worry about the three-quarter that's just what it means is fantastic quality pictures at a good affordable price"
554,ok do you have any other cameras that can just look at
554,"So basically in the range what we call the prosumer cameras, where you can take these affordable but fantastic picture, over there we have the family and friends cameras, its only $68 and fully automatic, design for pictures with family and friends, going out on picnics, going to friends weddings"
554,"Over here this is the top end photojournalism camera, and it's used for fashion shoots as well a number of scientific applications, it's got complete creative control, and then after that you decide what lens you use according to what you want to do what pictures you want to take"
554,okay do you think this camera is good for news
554,"A lot of Newspapers use this camera, and often supply them through their journals,if it's your own camera and the local newspaper, it's probably overkill, if you're looking for a full professional future newspaper photography, this is probably something you're going to need, you really only have two choice between two brands at the canon or the nikon"
554,oh I think I will take the Sony and then later on as I get better I'll think about buying the Canon later
554,"sounds like a good decision, when would you like to come in and pick it up?"
554,how about tomorrow is that okay for you
554,"I come on shift at 11, so you again if you can come in then I'll be ready for you to be ready to be picked up"
554,sounds like a plan I'll see you tomorrow
554,see you tomorrow
554,okay have a good day
555,good evening how can I help?
555,mmm I'm just browsing the camera for myself just something a little better than my camera
555,what do you have at the moment?
555,I only have my camera phone
555,do you like the pictures you take with it?
555,its so so but the resolution is not good I'm looking for something with better megapixels
555,"So you like the kinds of photographs you are taking, but you want them to look better and maybe be a little easier to work with?"
555,exactly
555,"Yes the nikon here is designed exactly that in mind, it's a family and friends kind of camera, so takes parties to weddings to picnics to the beach camera, anybody in the family can use it but at the same time it's point-and-shoot"
555,okay I see so what is the price for this
555,68 dollars
555,ok perfect for my budget okay do you know the optical zoom range
555,"please pick it up and take a picture, just have a little play with it if you like"
555,ok
555,"The lever over here is the optical zoom, so if you remove that forwards and backwards you see how your framing changes"
555,oh wow this is very nice okay I like this one
555,it has a similar sensor as your phone but a much better lens so the pictures are dramatically better
555,ok one more question what about the manuals setting is this is it OK or how about how do I use the manual settings
555,"It's similar to your phone, they'll be inside a menu, it's a touch screen and then you have to work through those, they are very limited like the photo little bit dark or light and some limited focus control, mostly it's easy to just leave it alone"
555,OK I'll think about it but I'll let you know later on yeah just think about it and I'll come back whenever
555,no problem come back anytime you like
555,perfect thank you very much for your time
555,thank you have good afternoon
555,alright you too
556,excuse me do you know how good the present modes is
556,ah yes the preset mode
556,"This is a great camera, it's a lot of manual settings, but you can also use it on full automatic, so the idea of the preset modes is if you're in extreme environment something different or doing something special, like a portrait, you can tell the camera that and it will automatically choose the best settings for that situation"
556,okay I'm looking for a really good quality camera but I want something really expensive but nothing too expensive just in the middle or do you have something in that range
556,"the top of the line is 2000 dollars just for the body and over here something that's similar to a mobile phone camera, but a fair bit better, 68 dollars"
556,okay which one do you recommend is good for let's see for a like fashion photography
556,"fashion photography means a lot of creative control and things can change, so most fashion photographers actually have to buy the top end photojournalism camera, is this a business you are interested in?"
556,kind of sort of but just a kind of want to stay in my budget but if its if it's better quality than I think I might buy it
556,how was your work used?
556,it's every day taking pictures
556,whereabouts is this published?
556,online business so I'm just trying to get it started
556,Can I ask what sort of camera you had before?
556,I used to have a Canon DS
556,Was that a film camera?
556,Yes it was the DSi I believe
556,"this is the only camera that can compare in quality with your old camera, how old are lenses you had?"
556,I'm not quite too sure maybe in 5 years
556,"This is a very big investment it's $2000 for the camera body, but please hold it in your hands, you'll see it weights a full kilogram, so it's quite heavy but it's ergonomic shaped for your hand, it's designed to work well on the range of tripods as well"
556,this is a tough decision but just give me some time and
556,perhaps if we set up with a lens and a tripod and a test shot and if you came with your laptop you might like to run through some of your own trials with the camera and see how you feel about using it
556,ok um I think I'll probably get the Sony camera but
556,let's have another look at that
556,"generally speaking you don't have the full creative control that you have for the other camera, but you do have manual settings control the depth of field, the shutter speed up to 30 seconds only, so depending on the effect you want you have that shutter speed limit, but a lot of creativity up to that point"
556,ok
556,"It's designed to be a travel camera so it's excellent in the field, in the studio it's not as flexible to work with but it will take great shots it will go on a tripod and can be automatically triggered"
556,ok sounds like a good good choice so I will take this if you don't mind
556,"we will order one for it will be here tomorrow at 10, here is my business card as well, see you tomorrow"
556,ok perfect thank you so much for your help
556,see you
557,good afternoon how can I help?
557,on looking for a camera for my best friend but I'm looking for something cheap
557,"this camera over here makes a fantastic gift, in a real camera after using mobile phone, so that's good for family and friend pictures going on picnics going to the beach, that sort of things"
557,do you think this camera is too cheap
557,"It's $68 and depending on the sort of pictures your friends are used to seeing, picture quality is a big improvement over mobile phone pictures"
557,ok what about the weight is it heavy or is it
557,"pick it up and take a few pictures if you like, it's only 120 grams"
557,ok
557,You see the lever here is the optical zoom so if you press that you can see how your framing changes as you zoom in and zoom out
557,oh wow its looks nice
557,take a picture
557,ok
557,oh wow this is awesome oh god
557,"yes people are surprised by how cheap these cameras are, but they have to compete against mobile phones so they have to make an extra effort to be good and affordable"
557,hmmm ok you know what can I come in next week and buy this camera
557,sure thing in next week I'll make sure we put the full color range so you can make a choice as a gift and we have gift wrapping available
557,okay that sounds like a plan for me
557,"ok here is my business card and a brochure about the camera, look forward seeing you next week"
557,I'll see you next week thank you for your time
557,thank you have a good evening
557,alright you too
558,Excuse me can you help me
558,certainly how can I help?
558,I'm just trying to look for a camera just to take pictures but also a really high end camera
558,You like taking pictures of family and friends going out on picnics and to the beach?
558,yeah but just kind of want to have a cool looking camera that looks very expensive
558,"over here the Sony a6000 is a very practical camera, and it's attune to the professional eye, you can take some really high and looking photos with this, you got a lot of creative control but the practicality is you can use it for family and friends pictures too"
558,ok what about the I don't know what the ISO
558,The iso goes up to 3200 such pretty good in low light condition
558,Please pick it up and take a few pictures
558,ok
558,The general rule is the heavier the camera the better the camera at 470 grams and this is a quality camera
558,"it's designed for travel, so it's all about taking great pictures in a lightweight package that doesn't get in the way"
558,Okay let me think about it do you have a more is this the most stylish camera
558,it's probably not the most stylish camera but it's available in silver white and a special edition in black
558,okay I'll take the black one then
558,"We shall put it together it will be ready for you in an hour, does this needs to be gift-wrapped sir?"
558,yes definitely different
558,We will have a range of paper for you to choose from as well so if you can come back in an hour
558,okay sounds like a plan
558,Thanks for your time will see you soon
558,I'll see you later
559,excuse me can you help me sir
559,Yes certainly
559,um I am looking for a really good camera to take high end wedding pictures
559,"You really only have a choice of two cameras the nikon or the Canon we carry the Canon 5d Mark 3, have you used canon before?"
559,no not really but I try one once before
559,are you working for a company at the moment or freelance?
559,kind of both but I'm trying to sneak away from my business
559,you need to buy this personal it's not something the company will cover?
559,exactly
559,"difficult time, so this camera body weighs kilogram in weight which you probably know, you already use something similar, but you will have to buy extra lenses in this condition, we sell the body only for 2000 dollars"
559,ok what about the auto focus points
559,"compare to  the previous model there is less, they actually change the software so they can get a really accurate fast results from less data, there 61 autofocus points"
559,Wow okay okay so would this be a recommended camera from you
559,"If you're doing wedding photography at a professional level, it's probably the only camera you can choose, there is the nikon which I'm afraid we don't carry but it's worth a look, but it's the lens it's going to be the most important for you possibly with the more expensive part of this package"
559,ok
559,"you do have full creative control, every aspect of this camera can be set to operate manually, it can also be triggered automatically from a range of sources such as infrared, or wifi, it can also serve as service for a number of slave flash units"
559,ok give me a moment and I'll think about it but I think I want this
559,can I ask are you working with software on a laptop?
559,yes I am
559,"Perhaps you'd like to bring your laptop in and we can set you up to play with the camera for an hour or two, we have a test area where we can setup a test chart you can check the resolution with your software"
559,okay sounds like a plan I'll bring my laptop and next time and I'm going to text a couple test shots and see how it looks so
559,if you could also let us know here is my business card if you could drop me an email what do you want 30 for favorite lenses we will try to have the Canon version of that available with the camera so you can test them
559,that works for me so I'll see you next time then
559,just let us know when you're coming and will be ready for you
559,I'll see you again
559,thank you for your time
559,thank you
560,good afternoon how can I help?
560,I'm looking for let's see looking for a birthday present for my friend who really love camera but I don't want to buy a super camera but just in the middle because the person really like to take fancy pictures
560,"It's very difficult as a gift, can I ask what sort of pictures, so fancy pictures but are they mostly of people at parties or does he go traveling a lot?"
560,Mostly parties he's like a promoter so he takes a lot of nightclub pictures
560,Is he a promoter himself recording his events or is he actually trying to work the photographer and use them in his marketing?
560,Yes he is trying to use them in this market
560,"The sony a6000 will give you very good picture, the qualities almost as good as the top end fashion camera, but it's only $550, and feel the weight it's 470 grams, for camera with this picture quality it's incredibly light, you can put that he would probably settle down to one or two lenses he likes best, the standard zoom that comes with this camera would probably suit him quite well"
560,ok maybe you know what can I get can I get this one then and if I can I'll get this
560,"Here is a brochure that describes a camera more fully and you'll see it describes some of the technicalities about to camera also has a sample of the images that it's been used to create including some nightclub pictures, here is my name card, perhaps if you want to have a read and come back in tomorrow and we can discuss it further"
560,sounds like a plan for me so I'll just get back with him and just confirm it and I'll let you know
560,have a read in a double check that the specifications here are exactly what you
560,perfect sounds good to me
560,thank you
560,thank you
561,good afternoon how can I help?
561,I'm just browsing but just trying to find a camera but I don't know what camera is really good
561,"let me explain the layout of the store, the nikon here is the next step up from a mobile phone camera, so it's point-and-shoot,  it's normally used fully automatically, very little manual control but it's fantastic for families friends picnics, and it has really nice pictures you can make some nice prints from it"
561,"Over here the Sony camera is the next step up, the nikon is $68 is $550, but it takes pictures as good as the top end camera almost as good, it's a great camera for learning some of the technicalities of how cameras work, and what you want to do, what you will find for extended travel, people who want to take really great pictures while they are out on expedition but don't need to be close-ups of the lion face, so with with that kind of intention it's actually become a very flexible midrange camera"
561,"Over here we have the Canon photojournalism camera, which is also very extensively used in fashion photography, it has a lot of science applications"
561,"the camera body itself is capable of anything, the picture quality is decided by the lens you attach to it"
561,"I can let you browse around the cameras, but can I ask first what sort of pictures you like to take"
561,just a few snaps here and there but nothing too fancy
561,family and friends
561,Yeah just family and friends but maybe I come back another day just trying to see what kind of cameras you have
561,"well that was a range for what you so far taking pictures of, the nikon is designed to do that kind of work. Here is a brochure about it so that you can read further here here is my name card"
561,and anytime you want to come in and test the cameras that's fine just come by
561,sounds like a plan for me um yeah I'll let you know next time when I come by and thank you very much for your help
561,thank you for your time have a good evening
561,thank you too much
562,excuse me sir do you know how much is this camera
562,"This camera is $550, it's designed for extended travel,l it takes really nice pictures"
562,is this really a top-of-the-line camera or so so
562,"it's a middle of the range camera, so the pictures are almost good as a top of the line camera, but it doesn't have a huge amount of manual control, it's a lot simpler to use, it's designed to be quick and easy to use for long journeys"
562,okay yeah I have a camera at home but it's not really doing good for me so I really want to upgrade so do you think this camera is really better for me
562,what sort of camera do you have at home and what are the frustrations?
562,um its my camera phone
562,any camera will be an improvement
562,but how do you find that frustrating to work with?
562,I just want some better pictures
562,do you take a lot of picture?
562,just a better high quality picture and that's it
562,yes
562,"Over here nikon is only $68, it's designed to directly compete with mobile phone cameras"
562,"The picture quality is excellent, it has a 20 megapixel sensor, it has a good lens in front of that, please pick it up and see how it works have a play"
562,okay let me see
562,"Here is the optical zoom switch, so you can just have a little play with that see how it changes the framing"
562,ok not too bad not too bad
562,"the big difference with the mobile phone camera is the quality is the same right across all that zooming, whereas a mobile phone of course it's something more you zoom in the worst the quality it gets"
562,okay yeah I think I'll take this camera this will be better than my camera phone
562,"It's also very light to use, point and shoot, so yes sir that's great will have it ready for you tomorrow"
562,that'll work thank you
562,We'll see you then have a good evening
562,thank you so much
563,excuse me sir can you help me
563,yes of course how can I help?
563,I want to know what kind of colors do you have for this camera
563,We have black of course but we also have white silver
563,ok is that a special black o is just a regular black
563,all the colors are special it's an excellent camera
563,ok ok what about the weight is it heavy
563,pick it up and take a few pictures if you like
563,ok let me see
563,"It weighs 470 grams so it's a little heavier than most point and shoot cameras, but it's designed to take excellent quality photographs on long journeys"
563,ok do you have any other cameras
563,"We have point-and-shoot automatic cameras which are available in a range of colors, and we have top end fashion science and photojournalism cameras"
563,okay let's see
563,"depends on the pictures you take, family and friends or fashioned and research and news"
563,I just want to take a high quality picture but just for show
563,in competitions
563,yeah I'm not really knowledgeable about cameras just want to have that high quality effect
563,"I will still suggest this camera I think, you will get almost as good as a high end professional camera, but you won't to think about the details of how it works so much, but you will still learn all the concepts you've got a lot of manual control of this camera"
563,ok maybe you know what let me eat dinner first and let me come back in and I'll let you know
563,"Of course here is a brochure, have a little read as you have your meal and happy to see you anytime you come in"
563,thank you so much for your help
563,Thanks for your time have a good night
563,thank you
564,how can I help?
564,I'll just wanted to know about the Sony Alpha is the camera a high quality camera
564,"it takes really good pictures almost as good as a top end professional camera but it's been designs down to be a mirrorless camera so it's much lighter, pick it up and take a few pictures"
564,ok
564,"It weighs 470 grams, about one and half pounds so it still feels heavy but mostly that's processing and some of the glasses in there, so while we call it mirrorless, it still has a lot of quite heavy components to guarantee the quality and the build and of the photograph"
564,ok what about the sensor size
564,"It has a three-quarter sensor so it's pretty good in low light you're going to get very good crisp photographs, it's fantastic for large enlargement"
564,ok what about the ISO as well
564,The iso is 3200 with a shutter speed of 30 seconds so depending on your creative effects you can shoot up to mid evening quite well
564,do you have a or high end camera
564,of course
564,"over here is the Canon 5d mark 3, this is a top of the line full professional camera body only, and the lens would be extra and the camera body the camera body weighs 1 kilogram and the lens can weigh 1 kilogram or more"
564,you know what I'm in a rush can I just buy it now
564,can I ask what sort of lens you like to use?
564,anyone would do I'm just trying to get a camera real fast
564,Certainly we have one set up over here and if you're okay with an 18 to 50 zoom I think that will give you a very good results
564,Ok I trust you so I feel confident though thank you so much
564,do we need to gift wrap this?
564,no no gift wrapping
564,then we will have it ready for you while we do some warranty paperwork and if you want to take a cup of coffee it will be ready to pick in twenty minutes

565,68 dollars
565,wow that's cheap really cheap but is it a good camera even though it's cheap

568,well mainly like anything I want something that can be used in any scenery
568,"Family and friends, would you like to take higher quality landscape pictures as well?"
568,no no just for fun
568,"This nikon is designed for family and friends, it's a good fun camera it's very light and very easy to handle"
568,oh yeah it's it's like what do you have anything on it or any other colors
568,yes this camera comes in black silver white red and purple
568,oh I see and what about the automatic settings I just wanted to press a button and take a picture
568,this is a point and shoot camera so you can just set it up so that you never need to touch another thing
568,What about the price
568,its only $68
568,do you have another camera that I can take
568,"certainly let me just explain the layout of the shop, over here we have high end professional camera so that camera bodies around $2000, and over here we have a camera that's in the middle for about $550, you have a camera that will take fantastic quality landscape photos and travel photos, it's too good for family and friend photos"
568,oh I see what about the weight of this one
568,it's around about half a kilo please pick this one up as well take some pictures if you like
568,oh yeah but I don't know I don't like the design very much
568,It's also quite expensive it's designed for extended travel and people who want pictures almost as good as high-end cameras
568,no no I'm not I'm not that good at taking picture I just want something simple just for the memories in something very simple to use
568,oh let's see let's check it again
568,the nikon is designed for what you're trying to do I think
568,take some pictures with it
568,how do you turn it on
568,there is a switch just here
568,oh I see let me take a picture of a beautiful lady
568,you'll also see there is an optical zoom lever just here that can adjust your framing
568,oh I said in and can I take pictures like at night with this one
568,"It has a built in flash so it will work quite well with family and friends in close proximity, but if you want to take pictures of sunsets maybe it's not so good at that in low light conditions without a flash"
568,thank you very much for your help no problem come back anytime
568,have a good afternoon
568,thank you goodbye
569,good afternoon how can I help?
569,I'm looking for a simple to use this looks amazing but kind of expensive
569,"yes it weighs a full kilogram and it got very complex settings, can I ask what sort of pictures you like to take?"
569,I am just going to have a trip so I'm I'm looking for something very simple to use
569,"we have two cameras that are quite simple to use and can be set the full automatic, the sony over here is $550 and it takes excellent quality pictures almost as good as this camera, the Nikon over here is $68 and is designed for friends, picnics, it's a fun camera"
569,and what about the resolution of this camera
569,"It's 20 megapixel sensor and 5 times optical zoom and together with it, it's a big step up from your mobile phone straightaway for price"
569,what what is the what is the of the optical zoom how does it work how far can I zoom
569,"Let's give it a go take it take a picture if you like, you can see this lever here is your optical zoom zoom in and out and see you gonna five times range"
569,oh let's try yeah actually it's very good do you have to have a camera with a better zoom like a 20 times or something
569,"The cameras in the shop take interchangeable lenses, so back to the lens you buy, this camera for instance is $550  and an interchangeable lens give you a twenty times zoom will be another five hundred dollars"
569,I just want something simple
569,"yes the Nikon is quite good for your needs, if you're used to taking pictures with your mobile phone, it can work in a similar way but the result is much better and the shutter is much more responsive, you don't have that annoying lag when you lineup your mobile phone camera"
569,oh I see I see just like that I don't really like the color of this one do you have other colors
569,we also got it in black silver red and purple
569,so purple sounds good and what about some manual settings
569,it's got limited manual settings so you'll be able to make the picture a little bit lighter or a little bit darker but not too much else
569,oh I see I see and can you tell me the price again about this
569,its only $68
569,ok thank you very much for your health
569,anytime have a good afternoon
570,good afternoon how can I help?
570,I am looking for a camera something like you know I'm a professional photographer but I am going to have a trip and I don't want to take like something that big but you know good enough for me to be able to pull some of these pictures
570,"The Canon 5d mark 3 is a professional, you're probably used one before but you know its already weighing a kilogram before you add other things like your kit which could make it two or three or five kilograms"
570,I use models like this for a my work but I'm looking for something like a little bit lighter than this
570,have you seen the sony a6000 before?
570,oh no no no show me please
570,"So the quality of photos from this is almost as good as the Canon, no you still have to be a little bit careful with how you handle it in your software, but pick it up feel the weight this this has a standard lens on it"
570,oh I see and do you have different color
570,it comes in black white and silver
570,what about the autofocus can I can I set in different distances
570,"It has different zone for the autofocus, 179 auto focus points, and the software is very fast it's very responsive you can choose the area you want to focus and it'll follow the movement in the frame as well"
570,I am very interested in long exposure pictures can I use this camera
570,"There are limits this camera will go up to 30 seconds exposure but if you want to go to anything longer like a minutes or  even a week, you need a bulb setting on the camera end you would have to go back to something much heavier"
570,thank you very much for your help
570,no problem see you again
571,excuse me
571,I am Looking for what I can they get more exposure pictures and I really care about the price goes for my job
571,oh so you're looking for a business package full creative control sort of camera?
571,yeah yeah what are the options here
571,"the Canon 5d mark 3 will be able to do anything you want, so if you got a top shutter speed of 30 seconds, then you have a setting where you can keep the shutter open for as long as you wan, a minute, an hour, or a week"
571,oh I see and what about this sensor size
571,This is a full-frame CMOS sensor so it's got outstanding resolution and you have great performance in low light with full-size sensor and an ISO 6400
571,what about the manual settings it seems is quite taken to put everything in manual mode and I am used to this kind of camera
571,You Can do everything in manual mode so it will also give you software style graph that you can manually set to adjust histograms and tone within the camera manually
571,have you use the canon before?
571,No not this will actually more like it
571,"because if you know anybody with some old lenses, lenses under about ten years old I compatible with this camera body as well"
571,oh really that sounds very interesting and what about the price
571,this camera body is $2000 and then of course the lens will cost extra paper please pick it up see how it feels in your hands
571,oh actually it's lighter than other models I have tried what's the weight
571,"this camera body weighs a kilogram but remember it doesn't have a lens on it, so that will double the weight"
571,looks like a very good camera well thank you very much
571,no problem have a good afternoon
572,good afternoon how can I help?
572,hello like I want to buy a camera with all this this looks like enough for what I need
572,can I ask what sort of pictures you like to take?
572,I am Going to have a trip but I want to take sunset pictures
572,so you want good quality pictures at an affordable price
572,definitely something that I can I can take professional pictures but I don't want to take my big camera
572,when you traveling that sort of weight can get in the way and you got to focus on your pictures
572,"The Sony a6000 is designed to take pictures almost as good as the top end cameras you been using, but feel how light it is it's only half a kilogram"
572,"it's actually a mirrorless camera so lot of the mechanisms in the big cameras are not here, so that's how they managed to save a lot of weight"
572,I see compared to the full professional camera what are the disadvantages of this one
572,"the disadvantages well firstly the shutter speed only goes up to 30 seconds, and you have a long exposures you can take"
572,what about the manual setting how flexible is this
572,"you can settle the basic things manually like a shutter aperture, iso, but after that you can set a white balance but that's the limit"
572,I see and what about their preset mode
572,"it has 9 preset modes that you can experiment with and depending on how you want to balance it out, you can access them through a menu system"
572,do you have any different color
572,we have it in black and white
572,only black and white well
572,I'm afraid so
572,"it's designed to be a camera for a purpose, for people who love traveling and who are traveling light but still want to take great photos"
572,what about artistic effect or something
572,"There are some artistic effects built into this if you want to upload directly to Facebook with some glasses drawn onto people, change the color of the hair, and so forth, they are similar to the artistic effects in your mobile phone up"
572,oh I see his sounds very very interesting
572,thanks for your help
572,anytime have a good afternoon
573,fine thank you I'm looking for a camera I am just looking for something simple
573,"Something simple, let let me explain the layout of the shop quickly, over here we have full professional cameras, very complex very expensive very heavy"
573,"Over here we have cameras that around about $550 take fantastic travel photographs and quite light, but fairly simple if you put them in automatic mode but they also have manual override"
573,this sounds like a very good option to me but let's take a look of this semi professional one
573,"over here at the nikon we have a camera that's incredibly easy to use, its full automatic point and shoot, design for family and friends and for getting out and having fun when you don't want the camera to get in the way"
573,sure it's designed for people going to exotic locations doing something exciting you can do a trip of a lifetime with this cameras
573,can I take these pictures pictures with the camera underwater
573,"Only with a special accessories, so all of these cameras are not waterproof unless you put them inside a housing"
573,oh I see and what about the weight it's like oh but what's the weight actually
573,half a kilogram
573,and what about the price
573,"$550, the next step up to a full professional camera would be $2000 without a lens"
573,oh my god I think it I think we should go back to the nikon one
573,"you will still take beautiful pictures with this, it has a 20 megapixel sensor you can get some very nice enlargement out of it, and it's much easy to use the parties and when you go hang out with people so it's a much easier camera to use"
573,what about the resolution
573,"20 megapixels and it has a great lens, this camera is designed to compete directly with your mobile phone camera, so the quality is so much better but it's so much easier to use, and its only $68"
573,does this have this kind of preset mode
573,Yes the preset modes let you tell it sometimes you are in the snow at the beach if you're shooting fireworks or portrait so it can choose the best settings for you
573,thank you very much for your help
573,no problem have a good afternoon
574,good afternoon how can I help?
574,I'm just looking around
574,"Take your time, let me quickly explain the layout of the shop, here fantastic social cameras point and shoot, go out have fun, over here is the top end professional cameras,  fashion photography go to space, over there are lightweight midrange cameras that are fantastic for going on long journeys, expedition of a lifetime where weight is an issue and don't want to carry much around, so quick price range this is $68, $550, $2000, take your time I'll just be over here if you have any other questions"
574,thank you very much
574,"Would you like to take pictures with any of the cameras, we can set one up for you"
574,oh thank you very much I was just looking around
574,no problem
574,thank you very much
574,have a good afternoon
575,good afternoon how can I help?
575,I'm looking for a good camera like nothing like full automiatic I think I want take with real pictures so can you show me what are your options here
575,"Sure, basically we have the top end photojournalism camera here, this camera body is $2000, pick it up see how it feels in your hands, weighs around about one kilogram, and then when you add a lens that can double the weight"
575,it has full manual control for total creativity
575,what about their long exposure or can I take can I take with this camera
575,"the standard shutter settings got to 30 seconds then this camera has a special setting called a bulb mode where you can keep the shutter open forever if you want so if you want to expose for a minute, a hour, a week, yeah that's fine just camera can do that"
575,what about the iso how good it is
575,"it goes up to 6400, so it's really good in low light and with the CMOS sensor, a full-size CMOS sensor and a good sensitivity like that the nighttime pictures have really low noise very low noise, very crisp"
575,how big is there is a sensor
575,"Full size so it's equivalent as 35 millimeter frame of stills film, can I ask what sort of pictures you've taken in the past?"
575,well I take pretty much anything because this part of my job it depends what people want like I do events also I do like scenery picture like this before and you know kind of magazine
575,"this camera is designed for printer output as well, so when you see pictures and glossy magazines it's used coming out of this camera or the Nikon equivalent"
575,I quite like this
575,have you use the older models of 5d?
575,yeah yeah yeah
575,"If you pick this one up again and feel it in your hand you will see the big change of the previous models, is the way the bodies sculpted to fit and sit in your hand, the ergonomics is much better"
575,yeah I actually feel better I still like everything is more comfortable

576,"A lot of year old lenses may work with this camera, you're free to bring them in if you want to test them out , but for the moment the $2000 is body only"
576,I have a lot of lenses I can try them what about the ISO
576,"It's probably similar to the previous model you've used, so it goes up 6400 ISO and it still has the CMOS sensor and full-size, so the low light pictures are really good and crisp"

576,well thank you very much for your help

577,yeah I did Looks simple to use what are these preset modes
577,they're all about the because the camera's automatic sometimes you have to tell it if you're  in somewhere a little bit out of the normal snow storm or out on the beach bright sunlight or taking a portrait that just tells you tells the camera what's so it can make the best decisions for you
577,oh i see and my friend knows a lot about cameras does it have manual settings
577,"this is design to be point and shoot it has some manual setting through the menus but not much flexible, you can make the picture lighter in darker but other than that very basic menu settings"
577,thank you very much
577,anytime have a good afternoon
578,good afternoon how can I help?
578,I am looking for a camera that's simple to use but I can take good pictures I don't know about cameras
578,What sort of pictures do you like to take
578,I want to use like general using for parties for traveling or pretty much everything
578,"the nikon over here is fantastic, it's actually the next step up from your mobile phone camera so if you're used to using that, it's direct competition now, picture quality is a lot better there's no lag when you push the shuttered, it happen straight away please pick it up and take some pictures"
578,I feel like the resolution is not very good
578,"Have a  play with the optical zoom just here, zoom in zoom out, you can see how you can change the framing, the resolution doesn't change, you are still shooting 20 megapixel through the lens"
578,oh I see
578,can I ask how you're going to use the pictures like going on the internet or do you want to make prints?
578,I don't think I am going to make prints it's pretty much for internet and you know showing to friends and stuff but then I'd like to learn a few things about photography do you have like a more advanced camera
578,"yes sure, we have the sony alpha 6000 over here, it gives you access to a lot of the manual settings the other one doesn't have, so you can start to practice some of the technical ideas and photography. it's designed to be a beautiful travel camera. quite light fantastic pictures almost as good as a top end camera"
578,and what about the preset modes of camera
578,"it has 9 preset modes for the most basic different kind of conditions, so you can stay in automatic and let it makes some of those changes for you, or drop over into manual mode"
578,what is this ISO thing
578,"That's the sensitivity of the sensor inside the camera, at 3200 ISO you can take nice pictures in low light up to the middle of the evening"

579,I have lens to take pictures very very very far away can I use them this with this camera
579,"The Canon over here is the full photojournalism camera and if your lenses are under 10 years old, it will take those lenses, but the body is $2000 and it weighs 1 kilograms, please pick up see how it feels in your hands"
579,can you tell me the autofocus
579,"yes I can, can I just check how old your old camera was?"

579,what about the sensor size
579,This is a full size CMOS sensor so you're going to get beautiful performance and absolutely top end resolution
579,oh I see I guess it comes with usual manual settings what about this a long exposure pictures
579,basically the standard shutter speed goes up to 30 seconds but then in bulb mode you can keep the shutter open for as long as you choose

580,Perhaps this is more like what I need I want to just press a button
580,"this is a full automatic point and shoot cameras, incredibly easy to use"
580,"It has a 20 megapixel sensor and a nice lens so you can get some nice prints out of it, if you want enlargement on your wall and it looks great on HDTV to play your pictures back like that"

581,"Yes this is the new Sony camera, so it's only been out for around about time five years, with the kind of lenses it uses, if your camera is older than that you would have to buy new lenses, this camera however include a good basic lens that you can see on it now"
581,do you have something that is not new You know that I can use with my old lenses

581,Yeah yeah yeah you can say that
581,"it's something you enjoy and you have some lenses, are they Canon lenses?"
581,Yeah actually the camera they have is this is a Canon but it's like kind of old recently it's not working properly so I want to buy something new
581,how old is the camera?
581,its 8 years old
581,and the lenses are the same age?
581,yeah I bought them together so some after that
581,"this is the new Canon, this is the latest model probably your lenses will work quite well with it, please take it up see how it feels in your hand hands"
581,"canon's big development over the years it's been the sculpting of the body so that it ergonomically sits in your hand, it's very comfortable to use"
581,yeah actually I'm looking for something like this how much is this camera
581,"this camera body is $2000 if you want to test it with the lenses you have already, we can set it up for you we can set you up with the test chart you can put it though its paces, we would just need notice to get a camera ready for you and set it up on a tripod with the chart"
581,can I bring my lenses this camera to check if it works
581,"definitely please do, it's a big investment we encourage people to do that"
581,thank you thank you very much
581,no problem look forward to seeing you again
582,hey how are you
582,real good yourself
582,I am looking for a good camera but I don't want something that expensive so kind of a camera that can settle things manually can you show me what options you have
582,Yes of course you had a camera before?
582,yeah yeah I have an nikon like a gx6 very good camera a very professional with lenses and stuff but I am looking for something less expensive than that like a second camera
582,"this is designed for exactly that kind of job, its sony a6000 so as you can see it's quite light it up and have a play for like take some pictures"
582,"it's only half a kilogram, and the saving is in the mirror and mirror mechanism because it has fewer parts inside but the electronics are such that it still looks like it's top end photograph"
582,and can I do what can I do like long exposure pictures with this one or is just like it simple
582,"You have full manual control of most of the basic settings but the shutter speed only goes up to 30 seconds, after that you would have to go back to your nikon and use its bulb mode"
582,what about the megapixels camera
582,"it's got a 20 megapixel sensor but as you can see it's got a huge area of glass, so it's got a very clear vision through the lens, you can make some beautiful enlargements from this up to mural size"
582,oh I see and what about the autofocus points and the ISO
582,It's got 179 autofocus point so you can pinpoint anything almost anywhere in your picture and follow it around and keep it in focus quite well its very responsive
582,for low light it has an ISO 3200 so it's pretty good up to mid evening
582,oh I see this looks nice looks like and I like the color but what about the price this
582,it's $550 and for that you get a picture quality comparable with top end cameras
582,well thank you very much
582,no problem have a good afternoon
583,good afternoon how can I help
583,it's ok i am just looking around
583,feel free to browse if you have any questions I'll just be over it
583,thank you
583,actually i have a question
583,sure
583,I'm looking for a professional camera but I cannot see it in your store do you already have something like with full professional camera
583,"Of course over here you have the latest model, Canon 5d mark 3 so professional it's used for high end fashion shoots, it's gone to space, it's gone to deep sea with appropriate accessories, anything you want to do this camera can do"
583,oh this looks very good actually what is the size of the sensor of this camera
583,"this is a full size CMOS sensor, can I just ask will this be a camera you will be buying personally or will the magazine be helping you?"
583,oh I think I might buy from you
583,so you have some lenses at the magazine you have all the kits that's already there?
583,Can I use the old lenses
583,"generally yes, you can use old Canon lenses under about ten years old for this camera, but maybe it's best if you bring them in and you can come in on Saturday after ten we can set you up and you can practice with those lenses"
583,actually the lenses are pretty new no more than two years so I don't think I need to bring them to you tell me the price
583,the camera body is $2000
583,what about the manual settings this new camera still have all the manual settings of the old one
583,"in fact it has more manual settings, so now you can go in and you can do software style manual tweaks, so that in the camera you can have different histogram setting, different contrast setting as well, so if anything it has more manual settings it have ever existed before"
583,oh I see I should just have one last question what about long exposure pictures
583,The normal shutter speeds still go up to 30 seconds and after that you do have a bulb mode so you can use extreme long exposures for any special effects you used to do it
583,oh this looks like the ideal camera for me thank you very much for your help
583,anytime have a good afternoon
584,excuse me
584,hi how can I help?
584,I'm actually a professional photographer and an paparazzi do you have something more portable and more discreet that I can use
584,can I ask how close you were going to get to a talent?
584,actually that's hard to say but as close as possible I need the pictures to be high quality
584,so you're going to try and get in close rather than sit on a boat a kilometer away and focus in from this?
584,I will I will be in 20 meters I think
584,"this camera here is designed to take top end photos that can be reproduced in magazines, but it's light, it's portable and it's quite discreet, it's available in black even though we have a silver model on display so you know you don't have to go out with something bright and shiny, please pick it up and have a try"
584,You can see the autofocus is very responsive  it can follow the moving characters within the frame quite well
584,Does it come in night mode or something
584,"It does come in night mode but that can become very noisy and grainy if you're shooting video, generally speaking if your talent is in a brightly lit area, the iso goes up to 3200 so you should be ok"
584,what is the price of this one
584,it's only $550
584,I see thank you very much for your help
584,no problem it when you're ready come back and we can package one up for you

585,what kind of trip is it going to be?
585,I'm going to the beach with my girlfriend so I just need to find something quickly because I want some big memories with her
585,"this camera is perfect, it's designed to work with family and friends, you can give it to friends because it's just point and shoots, very little to learn and you can use it straight away"
585,I don't like the color do you have any other color
585,It also comes in black red purple and white
585,Does it come in artistic retouch effects I want to to look beautiful and perfect
585,it has 12 glamour modes to make your girlfriend look absolutely perfect and put a shine on your cheeks so that you can upload directly to Facebook through a wireless port
585,What about the resolution of the camera how many megapixels
585,it's 20 megapixels and it has a nice lens so if you want to replay the pictures on an HDTV or get some nice prints made its really perfect for that too
585,perfect for me just let is tell me what was the price
585,$68 and with that includes gift wrapping if you like
585,okay I think of the perfect
585,ok thanks a lot for your time
585,oh I'm sorry I forgot I forgot I forgot to ask you what's optical zoom
585,"Just quickly try to take a picture with it it, give it a zoom backwards and forwards, its a 5 x optical zoom so you can see that effect there"

586,do you have it in a different color
586,"This one comes in this color, silver, also white and black"
586,"we do have a cheaper model that takes fantastic photos, it's point and shoot less creative control, but the very good if you're not going to publish the photos, and they are for personal use"

589,no problem have a good afternoon
589,oh I forgot I forgot I have a question
589,yes of course
589,what about the resolution of this
589,"It's 20 megapixels which is comparable to an upper end mobile phone, but unlike a mobile phone shot the shutter is very responsive it's a beautiful glass in front pictures are far better"
589,thank you very much
589,have a good afternoon
589,you too thank you
590,good afternoon how can I help?
590,I'm just looking thank you very much
590,would you like me to explain the layout of the shop briefly?
590,oh yeah please
590,"Over here We have top end photojournalism and fashion camera, over here we have point and shoot cameras basic automatic around $68, and over here we have a camera that sits neatly in the middle around $550 if you go on the trip of a lifetime but you don't want to carry a bulky camera, please feel free to browse if you haven't a questions by all means just ask"
590,thank you
590,excuse me
590,Hey
590,I don't know a lot about cameras. I would like to buy a like a good camera and try sometimes manual settings but mainly use full automatic
590,"this camera can do both, it's got a really good simple manual settings that you can set or you can set it up so it's basically point and shoot, it has beautiful pictures almost as good as a top end camera"
590,oh I see what's the price of this camera it feels a little bit heavy what's the weight
590,It's $550 and about half a kilo
590,"it's one of the rules of life that the heavier the camera often the better rte camera, in this case it's got a lot of componentry to guarantee a quality photo"
590,oh I see does it have preset mode for sunset in my pictures
590,you can leave the camera on full automatic and it has 9 presets say if you're in a sunset or doing a portrait of standing in the snow and it will make the best choice for you for that setting
590,can you show me a better camera
590,"of course the next step up from this camera is a full photo journalism camera basically and it's used in fashion and scientific research, please this is the body only pick it up and you'll see straight away it weighs a full kilogram"
590,oh no this looks too much this looks too complicated for me I prefer the other one
590,It's designed to take photos that looked just as good but the camera itself is more discrete lighter and easier to use
590,what about the camera there
590,"please come and have a look, you can take some pictures with it too if you like"
590,"It's $68 and it's camera design for going out with family and friends, going to the beach just having fun, fully automatic 20 megapixels a nice lens on it so you can take some nice enlargements for your wall"
590,thank you very much
590,no problem have a good afternoon
591,good afternoon how can I help?
591,the price of this camera
591,this is $2000 for the camera body only
591,i see and do you have some lenses for this camera
591,"yes there available as separate accessories, many people to buy this camera have lenses from previous camera"
591,i see and what is the sensor size of this camera
591,it's full frame CMOS sensor and it has an ISO 6400 so its really good and crisp in quite low light
591,yeah I can see the new settings like what about the autofocus points of this camera
591,"it has 61 autofocus points which is maybe less you've been used to in the past, but the software has been redesigned so that it's a lot more responsive"
591,oh really I'm going to take some pictures
591,"there two big changes between this and the previous model, one is the autofocus points and the different system it uses, the other is the ergonomics of the body so you can feel how well it sits in your hand"
591,I can see the difference actually I have some nikon camera this is much lighter what's the weight of this camera
591,this camera body is one kilogram
591,depending on the kind of lenses you'd like to use the weight will go up from there
591,$2000 you told me alright
591,"Yes that's right, the nikon is a similar price"
591,ok thank you very much
591,no problem have a good afternoon
592,hi excuse me
592,hi how can I help?
592,hi I lost my camera I am looking for a quick replacement I don't have a budget because I am in a middle of a trip can you show me what options you have
592,what sort of camera was it?
592,you know very simple camera but just pressing the button
592,"this camera is $68, it's fantastic with family and friends its like the next step up from your mobile phone fully point and shoot, please take a couple pictures with it"
592,oh yeah oh yeah it seems very similar to what I had before do you have it in a different color
592,We have it in black white red purple and the silver
592,what about the resolution of this camera
592,"It's 20 megapixels, these days it's a big step up that happens about every 6 months now those that has a very nice lens on it and a 5 times optical zoom"
592,so even though its automatic you can sell it when you're in a special situation and it can give you the best possible picture for that situation
592,yeah it seems good for my trip but just in case do you have a better camera than this one
592,"Of course the next step up from that cameras is actually $550, it takes beautiful pictures comparable with a top end fashion camera, but you can see at $550 it's quite lights, relatively cheap for what it can do, you've got a lot of manual control if you want to take some more creative pictures on your trip this is a fantastic choice"
592,550 is kind of expensive
592,With the nikon you can still get some beautiful enlargement and it looks great when you replay the pictures on HD TV you can see it has an HDMI port as well
592,can I see it again
592,of course
592,you can see the screen flips out as well so if you are taking a selfie you can help line it up a little bit better that way
592,perfect perfect this looks very good camera thank you very much
592,enjoy your trip
621,good afternoon how can I help?
621,I'm going on vacation soon just looking for a small camera
621,"Yes this camera has very high specs, it's a photojournalism camera so it might be a little more than you're looking for"
621,can I ask what sort of pictures you take?
621,just random snapshots for vacation
621,"Perhaps you'll be interested in the nikon, it's a point and shoot camera everything is basically automatic so you can set it up take great pictures of family and friends take it to the beach picnic and get some nice holiday snaps too"
621,what color does it come in
621,It comes in this silver of course it also comes in black white red purple and pink
621,very nice can I use my point card
621,"of course we have a point card system and that will accrue to what's on your credit, it's only $68"
621,okay thank you very much
621,thank you for your time have a good afternoon
622,good afternoon how can I help?
622,oh hi I'm looking for a new camera I just broke mine
622,can I ask what sort of pictures you take?
622,just usually with my friends when we have parties
622,what sort of camera was it?
622,it was a Sony similar to this one but an older model
622,"this is designed to be a good lightweight travelling camera takes beautiful pictures almost as good as in camera and you can change the lenses on it as well, is that the kind of thing you use to have?"
622,yeah how is the low lighting
622,"the low light in this  is really good, it goes up to 3200 iso and it will take a flash as well of course and if you wanted to take longer exposures at sunset into the evening, it's got a shutter speed 30 seconds"
622,that sounds good how much is it
622,"this particular camera is $550 but pick it up feel how light it is, it's around 470 grams"
622,wow that's pretty impressive
622,if your mostly taking pictures of family and friends and going to parties we have an alternative camera over here for only $68
622,"This camera is the next step up from your mobile phone, it takes much nicer pictures, it has a 5 x zoom, a 20 megapixel sensor please go ahead and take some pictures with them"
622,ok
622,that's not bad
622,"it's designed to be the sort of camera that works in same way as your mobile phone, so family friends picnics simple shots like that, you can get some nice prints for your wall as well because of the high megapixels on the sensor, but it will never be as good as interchangeable lens camera that's a little higher end and design for lightweight travel"
622,okay thank you very much
622,no problem have a good afternoon
624,good afternoon how can I help?
624,I'm looking for a DSLR type camera
624,"the DSLR are over here and we stock the Canon, this is the new 5d mark 3, have used to Canon 5d before?"
624,no I haven't I just graduated from high school so I guess my parents are going to buy me a present and I want to camera
624,"so you looking to move into photography, learn some of the techniques or have you study photography before?"
624,I just use my dads DSLR camera so I'm pretty much entry level looking for nature shots and whatnot
624,this is the top end cameras I would choose a lot of fashion shoots and so forth if you pick it up you can see it weighs a full kilogram at $2000 and lenses cost extra
624,"we do have another camera that also takes higher end pictures but it's much cheaper, lighter, and is better for traveling around as well"
624,what kind of lens sets does it come with
624,"the Canon 5d mark 3, no lenses you would have to choose them and buy them separately"
624,how much would a the body and lens kit cost
624,a good standard lens around about 18 to 75 mil will be another it depends on the brand between 550 and 25000 dollars
624,do you mind if I try it out
624,Certainly we've got it set up over here with a the lens we discussed and a test chart so feel free to take a few shots
624,you can see it has a manual setting for basically everything including some of the settings you might be used to seeing in computer software
624,it's very impressive
624,have you thought about the kind of lenses you want to buy as well?
624,I'm just looking to take pictures with a good depth of field
624,I could also suggest the Sony a6000 which has good depth of field control with its interchangeable lenses
624,"it's a different idea to the DSLR, so with the DSLR contains a lot of mechanism around the internal glass with a pint of prism and a mirror this does away with all of that so pick it up and feel how light it is"
624,and it's much cheaper with the basic lens is  $550 rather than just a body for $2000
624,you can use manual lenses and a wide range of manual settings so that you can work with depth of field effect
624,that's a lot to think about thank you very much have a good afternoon
624,no problem have a good afternoon
625,good afternoon how can I help?
625,I'm just looking for a basic camera to take selfies with
625,so you have use your mobile phone for this in the past and you got some ideas about how you wanted to see it come together
625,yes but when I take selfies with my cell phone usually comes out blurry and dark
625,"it's a bit of an art isn't it, what we've got over here is the next step up from your mobile phone, it has a 20 megapixel sensor so the pictures will have more details in them, it also has a much bigger glass lens, so you won't be like this pair of glasses in front of the sensor, it's a much clearer crisper picture coming through pick it up take a few shots"
625,it also has a 5 times zoom and a flip out screen so you can check your framing
625,that's cool what colors does it come in
625,obviously this silver but also black red pink blue
625,It's very stylish and only 68 dollars because it''s the next step up from a mobile phone that''s its direct competition so it has to be affordable and take great shots
625,what is this glamour retouch effect
625,"you know when your mobile phone app, you've got  a lot of things framing and glitter on people,  this is built into the camera as well so that if you want it directly uploads facebook without having to go through too much software, you've got a lot of options inside the camera"
625,awesome that's really useful
625,it also has a range of presets so while it's set to be fully automatic point and shoot you can have a certain amount of control by telling if you're at the beach with the snow in the jungle and it'll choose the best settings for you
625,that's nice how much is it
625,only $68
625,I only have $50 on me
625,it's okay they're always in stock so call by anytime and just pick one up
625,okay thank you very much
625,no problem have a great afternoon
626,good afternoon how can I help?
626,I'm looking for a camera to replace my old one
626,can I ask what sort of camera you used to have?
626,I had a Minolta it was a point and shoots but it's very old
626,"Yes things have changed a lot since Minolta was making a point and shoot cameras, what sort of pictures you like to take?"
626,um pretty much everything sometimes pictures with friends sometimes sightseeing pictures
626,so you go traveling a lot and you're like really good pictures?
626,sometimes depends on the season I guess
626,do you like to take some manual control into your photograph so really point and shoot and have just keep having fun?
626,I usually just use the automatic setting so I don't know too much about the presets
626,"okay I'll quickly explain this camera it's designed to be a lightweight camera that takes as good as a top end photos but with that you will also have some manual control and interchangeable lenses, it's probably about the same price as Minolta  around $550"
626,but it might be a bit more than you're used to using unless you're actually interested in photography and the way photography works
626,over here we have the nikon
626,"Pick it up and take a few pictures if you like, it's set up to be point and shoot"
626,it has a 20 megapixel sensor so you can make some really nice enlargement from it
626,"and a 5 times optical zoom as well, I'm not sure what you're Minolta would have had to"
626,I had an nikon before but it broke really quickly so I have a bad taste in my mouth with nikon
626,"things have changed a lot, nikon have realize now with this camera that they have a lot of competition from mobile phones, so they have to make to the cameras more solid, take better pictures, more affordable, this should not break it comes with the three year warranty"
626,really ok and what colors does it come in
626,black pink silver red and blue
626,it's stylish and fun
626,how many megapixels does this have
626,"20 megapixels so some phones claim they have 20 megapixel sensor on this is much larger, and it has a much better lens, also the zoom is optical it's a 5 times optical zoom so you won't degrade the picture if you zoom right in on somebody's face for instance"
626,okay I'll think about it thank you very much
626,no problem come back anytime have a good afternoon
627,good afternoon how can I help?
627,I'm going on vacation soon so I'm looking for a camera that's good for the outdoors
627,can I ask what sort of pictures you like to take?
627,mostly of nature but I'm going to go scuba diving so I need something that's good underwater
627,there are underwater housing available for all our cameras but let me explain the lab the shop to briefly
627,"over here is automatic point and shoot, the problem with this and scuba diving is trying to focus especially to see his little cloudy that can be tricky"
627,"over here we have top end photojournalism camera that can be used in space, that is often used underwater, it's produced in glossy magazine level photos"
627,"over here sitting in the middle is a camera with a lot of manual control and a good underwater housing, it takes interchangeable lenses, you can put manual lenses on it go in manual mode, fiddle with exposure the pictures are almost as good as a top end camera"
627,that sounds good do you mind if I try it
627,"oh please take some pictures, it weighs around about half a kilo with the basic zoom lens we have on it now"
627,how much extra is the underwater housing for it
627,the cameras around $500 the underwater housing is around $600
627,it also limits the kind of lenses you can use the that's the nature of underwater photography
627,"compared with the Canon over here which weighs is the full kilo just for the body and the lens and the underwater housing is further, 7000 dollars but the camera body is only $2000"
627,this camera is designed for lightweight travel
627,how about the megapixels on it
627,"It's 15 megapixel but with a fantastic lens and fantastic processing of the three quarter chip, the results are almost as good as photojournalism camera, the differences maybe some print publications will be a little bit more critical of the high end, but if you want to show them on your  high def TV so forth It'll be very spectacular"
627,Does it have special presets for outdoor shooting
627,"If you want to go into full automatic mode you can still tell a time you're in the snow you're up the mountain you're at jungle, it's got 12 of those presets or you can do this is a combination with some automatic settings and some manual settings so manual shutter, automatic model and a preset for snow is one way you can go"
627,awesome okay thanks a lot
627,no problem have a good afternoon
628,good afternoon how can I help?
628,oh hi I'm just looking for a camera
628,can I ask what sort of pictures you take?
628,I've never owned a camera before so I'm kind of on a budget looking for something that takes good pictures and affordable
628,what you're looking at now is a high end photojournalism camera so not at all affordable and you can feel it weighs a full kilogram without a lens so it's very complicated to use I can show you a much simpler camera
628,"over here this particular nikon Coolpix is designed to be the next step up from your mobile phone camera, it's fully automatic point and shoot, it's great for pictures with family friends, and you can take some nice travel pictures with it too, it's a great first camera"
628,what special features does it have
628,"that's different with everybody, for me the fact it has a 20 megapixel sensor in a really nice lens on it means that even though it's designed to be a cheap $68, low end camera you can take some beautiful pictures makes you beautiful enlargement, playback on your high def TV, it can give you some great results"
628,how's the zoom on it
628,please switch it on and have a play
628,so you see it's a 5 times optical zoom
628,"one of the important things about this camera as against your mobile phone camera zoom is as an optical zoom, the quality of pictures the same all the way through on your mobile phone camera, as you pinch and squeeze you notice the picture gets worse if you zoom in"
628,yeah that's right this is very nice
628,"it also has some of the mobile phone app style effects built in, glamour mode so you can put glitter on somebody's cheeks or spike up their hair for them"
628,how will the price
628,its only $68
628,can you throw an SD card with it
628,For $68 it already includes a 16 gig sd card
628,that's a good deal do you take point card
628,of course
628,ok I'll think about it
628,no problem come back anytime it'll be great to see you again
628,thank you
628,good afternoon
629,good afternoon how can I help?
629,hi I'm looking to upgrade my DSLR camera
629,can I ask what sort of pictures you taking at the moment?
629,I'm taking a lot of pictures with families for people having babies in some the wedding photography too
629,Full professional kit. What kind of camera have you go to the moment?
629,I have an nikon but I've heard good things about canon
629,"this is a big trade over, it's a very big decision, have you use the canon before?"
629,I've only used my friends and it seems to be pretty pretty convenience
629,"this is the latest version of the Canon 5d mark 3, there are two big changes over the mark 2, pick it up and feel the camera body in your hand, they put a lot of work into sculpting it so it sits natural in your hand, Certainly for longer weddings the ergonomics becomes very important thing"
629,"also it only has 61 autofocus points, what they found is with better software interpreting the results, you can be much more responsive an accurate if it process less data that's well chosen"
629,you will need Canon lenses to go with this but there are deals we can put together for professionals
629,"for particular kinds of effects the sunset effects and so forth, you probably been taking it has an ISO of 6400 your basic shutter speed goes to 30 seconds but then you have a bulb mode so if you want to go for longer you can control it electronically that way"
629,Does it come with a warranty
629,a two year warranties yes
629,"this body is $2000 the lenses are going to be variable in price, so if you could have this together the kind of lenses you normally, use we can put a package together for you and do a quote"
629,I am looking for a big telephoto lens do you have that available
629,several brands several sizes
629,they're also available in several different major aperture openings so depending on how far open you want to take it that's going to affect the prices as well
629,sounds good
629,we can set one up in the store for you to practice against the test chart if you like bring your laptop in and so forth see how it goes with your software but we would need notice for that
629,that sounds awesome maybe I'll come back then
629,anytime on Saturday after 11 is good so if you is my business card if you want to drop me an email let me know what you're thinking and will prepare setup
629,okay I'll do that thank you very much
629,ok look forward to seeing you again have a good afternoon
630,good afternoon how can I help?
630,I'm looking for a camera
630,"I'll quickly explain the layout of the shop, over here we have high end photojournalism cameras, over here we have automatic point and shoot cameras, the next step up from your mobile phone, and over here is the camera sort of in the middle"
630,it takes pictures almost as good as a high end camera but it's much cheaper and it's much lighter
630,I want something pretty cheap but takes good pictures
630,can I ask what you take pictures of?
630,I usually just outings with my family and friends
630,"ok all of the cameras take good pictures so we wouldn't have them in the shop and that's kind of the trick is finding the right purpose, so this camera's around $550, it's design for lightweight travel, it can take stunning travel photography pictures, not quite as good as top end camera, but it's quarter of the price and is half the weight, and it packs down really well so a lot of people use it for long expedition"
630,"over here this camera is designed for family friends, its good fun camera fully automatic takes beautiful pictures and its design to not get in the way, please pick it up and take a few shots"
630,"that's great at parties it's great to see if your wedding guest, it's fantastic for picnics and so forth, it's a social camera"
630,"it has 20 megapixels on the sensor in a nice little glass lens, so it still really good looking shot that you can playback on a high def TV or get some nice enlargements made"
630,what are the settings for
630,that's for the optical zoom so if you got the camera and just move that lever to and fro and you can see the zoom in and out of the picture and it keeps the same consistent quality right through the zoom
630,so it's easy to use
630,point and shoot sometimes point zoom and shoot it depends on how you want to frame up the picture
630,if you're in extreme conditions like the snow with the beach it has a few presets where you can you can sell it now yeah I'm in this situation so it'll make some different choices some better choices for you but it can be fully automatic
630,what is this glamour retouch effect
630,"in your mobile phone app, you are use to having little section in your camera app where you can put glitter on somebody's cheeks before you put them on Facebook, this has 12 of those kinds of effects so that if you want to post directly to Facebook from the camera you can still be a bit Cheeky"
630,okay sounds good
630,It's only $68
630,how about the canon
630,now where the nikon is a 120 grams please pick up the canon and you'll see it weighs a kilogram without a lens
630,it's a completely different way of taking pictures of think
630,ok
630,The camera sold for purpose
630,I will think about it then thank you
630,No problem come back anytime we could see you again have a good afternoon
631,good afternoon how can I help?
631,I read in the news about a new mirrorless camera
631,"that's a sony a6000  over here, have you take a lot of pictures in the past you have a camera now"
631,I just have my cell phone
631,this is a big step up please pick up see how it feels in your hand and take some pictures
631,I've only seen this in commercials and on the news
631,can you tell me more about this technology
631,"its a way of taking pictures that are almost as good as a top end photojournalism camera for the fractions of the weight a fraction of the price, and for people who are interested in photography, want to lift their skills a bit, lift their games, this takes beautiful pictures is designed for lightweight expeditions if you like"
631,how does it differ from a DSLR camera
631,please come over here and you can feel the weight of a DSLR camera for yourself just pick it up and see how it feels it was a full kilogram and then the lens will weigh as much again so the package is usually around 2 kilos
631,"going back to the sony, you can see that unless you''re working in the studio setup or with a crew, it's kind of overkill so for people who wants that level of quality in the pictures but who need to travel around sometimes got a full auto mode sometimes going to take a bit of manual control, you got lots of options with this camera"
631,"it's $550 it's only half a kilogram, it's got a beautiful sensor on what we call a three-quarter crop sensor, so the pictures that come through respond very well through computer processing if you shoot in RAW mode"
631,what are these a special artistic effect mode features
631,"because a lot of people also use this camera with family and friends and so forth, it's got some of those options that you've got in your mobile phone apps where you can brighten people's smiles clear up their eyes, change their hairdo before you post to Facebook"
631,doesn't have a wireless feature
631,oh that's standard on all new cameras these days
631,sounds good how about the pricing
631,this is $550 but did you say if you have a camera at the moment?
631,I just have my cell phone
631,"this is a big step up if you're happy with the pictures you take with your cell phone, we have the next step up which is fantastic and it's only $68, but if you want to explore the options that photography gives you with control of the shutter speed and iris things like that, explore the technicalities this is a good first camera to move into photography as a hobby"
631,okay sounds good thank you very much
631,no problem come back anytime and we can take some pictures for the cameras and compare them for you
632,good afternoon how can I help?
632,I'm just looking around
632,"let me just explain the shop briefly too, over here we have mid-range cameras take beautiful pictures what you may call prosumer something like that, over there we have the photojournalism top end camera and over here we have the point and shoots, can I ask what sort of pictures you take?"
632,a bit of everything sometimes so pictures when I go out my friends sometimes vacation shots
632,"for a lot of people in your situation this kind of camera here works really well because it has a smaller range of lenses and something like a full photojournalism camera but it's a lot cheaper, it's quite light, please pick it up I'm not sure what to the camera you've really used in the past, but this weighs half a kilo, takes excellent pictures, almost as good as a top end"
632,how much is it
632,"its only $550, and with that you get the new mirrorless technology as well and you get the three quarter cropped sensor which with a nice lens on front, really produce a beautiful result,t response well with the files you produced, respond well with processing in software later on as well, take some pictures please go ahead"
632,can you take videos too
632,of course yes you'll see a mode which just over here
632,"the video are 4k resolution although if you were looking at a camera for actual video use, the canon also has 4k resolution but at 35 mil full frame sensor, the canon has been used for professional video shoot some things like American TV show house were shot on that canon"
632,but the video of this looks fantastic
632,"it has a number of autofocus points as well, this particular camera so you can track movement in the shot very easily"
632,the bit pricey anything cheaper
632,much cheaper over here
632,"this is only $68 it's still a really fun little camera to use, it's great for family and friends and if you want to go out and take some holiday pictures and so forth you get nice results it's fully automatic just point and shoot"
632,yeah take some pictures please. I go see the zoom lever is just over here
632,what colors does it come in
632,this is pretty stylish it comes in black silver white red and pink
632,the 20 megapixel sensor with a nice lens in front of it so the pictures come out quite crisp you can make some nice enlargements as well
632,okay I'll think about it then thank you very much
632,come back anytime have a good afternoon
633,good afternoon how can I help?
633,I'm looking for a camera
633,can I ask what sort of picture you take?
633,I'm getting into forensics so something with high resolution
633,understand right so you actually need to be able to filter out different wavelengths of light and work with lighting a great deal as well
633,yes and getting into the details of a body part someone that
633,yes in this situation is really only one kind of camera that suits your work which is that the Canon 5d mark 3 you probably seen it in the field a fair bit already
633,oh yes definitely
633,it has full manual settings so you'll be able to do the shutter speed and the aperture that are appropriate to isolate the features you want to pick up
633,oh it's heavy
633,"it weighs a full kilo its actually designed for this kind of work as well as photojournalism fashion shoots and so, for whatever you need to do you can do with this camera"
633,There is a range of special forensic lenses that include various grades in a moment devices and accept different filtration techniques as well
633,through the manual controls you'll also be able to set histograms in a range of color function which takes it that big step further along from other manual control cameras so again you'll be able to isolate different features of a crime scene
633,is it good in low light settings
633,"the shutter speed goes up to 30 seconds in a standard way, and the iso is 6400 with very little is so you'll protect the evidentiary aspect of the photographs you taking also it has a bulb mode so if you need to take extra long exposures ten minutes, or day or a week, you can do that with this camera"
633,how's the pricing on it
633,this camera body is $2000 and then specialist lenses of course I have a brochure about those and you'll be able to read through that
633,can I ask will this be a freelance role or is one of the crime organizations helping you with this?
633,I'm not at liberty to say right now
633,I understand but if you need us to put a quote together for submission to a different authority we can organize that for you too
633,ok you've been very helpful thank you very much anytime

634,does it take good pictures outside
634,takes beautiful pictures outside so if you got a bit of a trip as well you can get some nice landscapes
634,it has a 20 megapixel sensor which means it picks up a lot of detail and a very nice lens on it so its like a crisp eyes in front of that sensor
634,does it have a good zoom
634,"take some pictures see how you go, the zoom lever is just here and it's five times"
634,Do you take a lot of pictures with your mobile phone?
634,oh yes I do actually
634,"okay you can see already the difference with a real camera, when you zoom like this, the pictures the same quality right through a bad when you zoom with your mobile phone, the quality gets a lot worse"
634,you can see it only weighs 120 grams so it's very handy actually fits in your pocket

635,nothing really professional just a simple point and shoot camera
635,is he interested in photography works and building it up as a hobby?
635,yes I think so he has a lot of time on his hands now
635,"the sony a6000 takes beautiful pictures it's actually kind of what we call a prosumer camera so it takes pictures almost as good as a high end camera and gives you some manual control, quite a lot of mental control over the pictures you are taking, so if you want to learn more about photography, you can see what happens you can play with your shutter speed you, your iris, your depth of field, all those technicalities, or you can swap it across to full automatic mode if you want"
635,does it take good macro pictures
635,"this has interchangeable lenses so there a lot of options for how you take with macro pictures, if he really wants to zoom in on insects or flowers or flower pots things like that if you want to get creative, choose the right lens use a magnifying filter this camera has those sorts of options"
635,oh this is a mirrorless camera isn't it
635,"yes so it's quite light, most people have used heavier DSLR that weighs a kilogram but you see this weighs only half a kilogram with a lens on"
635,are Sony lenses interchangeable with different makers
635,no if you have sony lenses they do have to go with sony cameras
635,you can get adapter plates but always the best fits and the most reliable lens is one designed to work with that camera
635,nice how much is a pricing
635,this is only $550
635,"we have point and shoot fully automatic camera as well this one over here is $68, the manual control is very limited and quite complex, but if it's full of pictures of the grandkids. Can I ask do you have children?"
635,no i don't
635,"well if it's pictures of the family and general celebrations or going out with his friends or down to izakaya, this is a good fun camera he doesn't have to think about it you can take a lot of fun social shots"
635,please pick it up and take some pictures
635,you can see the lens and the optical zoom just here it's fully built into the camera
635,it's only $68 and great camera for all the family anyone can use it
635,ok
635,thank you for all your help
635,"no problem just remember when you thinking about your father this camera point and shoot use this right away, that camera a lot of options for exploring photography in the future"
635,ok thanks
635,no problem have a great afternoon
636,good afternoon how can I help?
636,I'm looking to take pictures of trains
636,"is it sort of freight train portraiture that you're interested in, would you like to maintain records of what trains happening where?"
636,I love trains so I like to take high-speed pictures of trains
636,"there are two main options here, this is the fully professional photojournalism style camera anything creatively you wanted to do to type pictures you could do with this camera, pick it up feel how it feels in your hands it weighs a kilogram and when you add lens it will double the weight"
636,lenses are extra
636,"yes and you can see how heavy it is how do you like to work in the field is, is it has a camera something you carry with you all the time"
636,only on the weekends so I might need a tripod for this too don't I
636,"generally yes, people would use this on a tripod although it can be set up to shoot handheld, but it's a particular skill if you're more interested in shooting pictures of the train, we have another camera come over here that might be more practical"
636,"The pictures out of this camera are almost as good as the top end camera, but please pick it up see how light it is, it weighs just around 500 grams and that's with reasonably good lens on as you can see, you have full manual settings so that if you want to set slow shutter speed and pan with the movement to create the effect of the movement you can do that with this camera, that kind of manual control which is very easy"
636,if you wanted to shrink the depth of field or use a large telephoto lens again you can do that with this camera
636,it has a three quarter crop sensor so you're going to get really good looking picture as well something that you can blow up prints and do it would you be planning to contribute to train magazines
636,no just for my personal collection
636,"no problem if your archive becomes interesting to a magazine, this will produced pictures that can be reproduced in that kind of publication"
636,so this takes really good action shots
636,"yes it does, this is excellent for action shots, we have cheaper cameras that will still take excellent pictures, but if you want to take pictures of moving trains in that context, you really need something where you got full control over the depth of field and the shutter speed"
636,okay I think I prefer the DSLR
636,let's go and have another look you will be working in the field correct
636,yeah I fully set up on the station platform
636,"alright so you're looking more at the slower picture still pictures of trains and so forth, will you be panning trains in the field movement and doing that from a tripod as well?"
636,yes eventually
636,"right pick this camera up have a feel, have you seen these in use before?"
636,yes many of my friends have this one
636,have you practice with it as well?
636,no this will be my first DSLR
636,"you can feel the ergonomics the way it feels in your hands, this latest model Mark 3 has a lot of attention being given to the way its sculpted to actually work with it in a handheld way, so mostly yes if you can you should use a tripod but the ergonomics is set up so that when is probably balance with well chosen lens it will still feel really good and will have a strong firm positive feel"
636,"it has a full size 35 mil sensor as well so you'll get the absolute best possible shot you can, and with every manual setting possible you got full creative control"
636,sounds great thank you very much
636,"no problem I should quickly mention it does well in low light as well so if you're looking for some evening shots, come in anytime we can set it up and you can I can give it a try"
636,okay I'll do that
636,Here is our business card and a brochure come in and set you up and you can use a test chart
636,okay thank you see you
636,thanks for your time see you again
637,good afternoon how can I help?
637,I am looking to take take pictures with a camera
637,have you had a camera before?
637,Yes simple point and shoot but I'm looking for something nicer
637,what sort of pictures do you like to take?
637,I usually I go outdoors on day trips so I like to take pictures of sights
637,so wider landscapes that sort of thing?
637,yes exactly
637,"the sony a6000 designed for exactly that, it has interchangeable lenses so if you want to start taking more creative pictures of smaller items like the flower in the field, you can do that too, it has manual control so that you can manipulate your  shutter settings, and your aperture, so you can depth of field effects"
637,that sounds really complicated do you have anything more simple
637,this can also be set to point and shoot mode that can be fully automatic
637,but over here we have the Nikon Coolpix switch it on the $68 its like the next step up from your mobile phone
637,that's a good price
637,"it's a next step up from your mobile phone, please pick it up and take a few pictures if you like, this is designed to be a sociable or use it with family and friends with a 20 megapixel sensor and a nice lens in front, the pictures are really good quality so nice landscape pictures and so forth, no problem"
637,does the screen touch screen
637,"yes it is, although most people prefer to use the voice to arrange with here because get away from that tricky thing when sometimes you just get the next setting alone"
637,"it has an optical zoom on it as well 5 times optical zoom, please have a look at the effect that does, and the big difference with your mobile phone again is the quality is the same right through every point of the zoom because its mechanical it's not digital"
637,does it take good videos too
637,"yes it does, sometimes the videos might look a little better if they are shot on the higher end camera but for family videos and so forth or for emergency videos, fantastic"
637,it's very lightweight 120 grams you can see if it's in your pocket as well
637,we have it in stock right now in black silver pink red and white
637,which color do you think suits me
637,"what color are you eyes, yes I think the red one"
637,yes i think the red one
637,thank you very much
637,no problem anytime
637,see you later
637,good afternoon
639,okay thank you very much
639,good afternoon how can I help?
639,oh honey I'm just looking to buy a camera for my high school graduation
639,so it will be pictures of the party in the friends?
639,oh yes exactly but also I want to use it after too
639,what kind of pictures do you want to take afterwards?
639,hello just simple shots everyday life I guess
639,"are you interested in the technicalities of photography, how it works for the shutter speed, what is iris that sort of thing?"
639,yes so what would you recommend
639,"this camera's perfect socially it's perfect camera for parties and social you don't have to think about it think, it's automatic point and shoot, it's $68 and has a 20 megapixel sensor in a nice little lens and a 5 times zoom"
639,let's compare it with this camera over here
639,"this camera is $550 so it's a big jump in price but it gives you  manual control as well so if you want to learn more about shutter speed aperture, play with some effects like panning. with moving objects or depth of field, this camera can do that and it can accept different lenses as well so you can build a lens kit and build some skills"
639,"it can also be put into full automatic mode with a simple lens, also fully automatic on autofocus so you can use it for all those great social events as well"
639,"please pick it up and take a few shots, you'll see it's got a mid-range zoom at the moment"
639,oh this is very cool what colors does it come in
639,white silver and black
639,how's the weight on it
639,"it's half a kilogram, the other camera is only 120 grams but it is designed to be very quick point and shoot sociable camera, this has a lot more construction in it if you''re like to give you that manual control also the separate adds a lot of weight"
639,but because it's a mirrorless camera it's missing a lot of the components in high end DSLR which weighs more than a kilogram
639,it's a perfect camera for learning the basics of how photography works
639,what are these preset modes
639,if you want to work in automatic then you can tell it what sort of extreme situation you might be in the beach on a bright sunny day if you're in the snow over if you deep in the jungle that helps the automatic brain inside the camera choose the best settings for you
639,what's the best the best price you can offer
639,"we could package that up with some other things such as filters the camera case and so forth, maybe think about what other items you would like and we can put a quote together for you"
639,okay that sounds good
639,we will have if you could get a list together for us will get that quote together and we can sort something out very quickly
639,sounds great thank you very much no problem thank you for your time see you again soon
639,no problem thank you for your time see you again soon
640,good afternoon how can I help?
640,hi I'm looking for a camera I'm I'm a journalist but I'm trying to get into photojournalism
640,have you worked with photographers before?
640,I have yes and night I noticed they use a lot of big DSLR type cameras
640,"this is probably a camera you've noticed them using in the field, the Canon 5d mark 3, have you used one before?"
640,I know now myself but this is really what I'm looking for actually
640,"pick it up feel the weight see how it feels in your hands it's a new way of working, isn't it"
640,oh yes
640,can I ask if you'll be going freelance or if your organization helping you to buy this?
640,currently freelancing
640,right we will have to think about what would have lenses you'd be needing to use as well and then we can put a business package together for around that
640,okay that sounds good
640,"you can see its got a full 35 mil sensor so it's perfect for print publication, but you can also set that it through the menu to take lower format pictures for direct uploading to the internet depending on what the spec is for your job"
640,for photo journalism it's really good in low light as well with ISO 6400 and shutter speed running up to 30 seconds you can get away in a lot of situations without using a flash
640,how to scan and compare with its competition
640,"the main competition is Nikon and I would say it's neck and neck they both worth a go, they are both excellent camera"
640,how's the auto focus points on this
640,"they're trying something different with this model, its only got 61 autofocus points, but they have refine the software so by working with less data so they can give you a more accurate results more quickly"
640,any manual settings
640,do you mind if I try to take a few shots
640,not too bad
640,mainly Photoshop
640,okay that sounds great
640,okay I'll give you a call then
640,thank you very much
640,okay here's my business card and a brochure and let us know when you're coming in and we'll have it setup for you
640,have a good afternoon
641,good afternoon how can I help?
641,I'm looking for a camera to take pictures of her me my friends we have a special hobby
641,what kind of pictures do you like to take with your friends?
641,we are really into cosplay so
641,specialist portraiture
641,yes
641,"how do you use those pictures, do you upload them to the net, do you contribute them to magazine?"
641,we have a group page where we share pictures so we want something with good color
641,"All of our cameras have great colors take great pictures and a fantastic for the internet, have you had a camera before?"
641,yes but it didn't take really nice pictures the detail was pretty bad and so was the colors
641,Are you used to using a camera technically?
641,I do OK
641,"ok this camera here takes interchangeable lenses so when people have muddy lookin colors or somehow the resolution doesn't look crisp, it's usually something to do with the lens, so this is $550 it's not too expensive, takes pictures almost as good as a top end camera and with interchangeable lenses you can work as simply as you want or as technically as you want, you can set it on full automatic if you want"
641,the most important thing is you got a good piece of glass lens in front of the sensor
641,can I upload pictures directly from the camera
641,"Yes you can and there are also different effect, this has a few artistic effects where you can put frames on the photographs and things like that and a few comments"
641,who is perfect
641,and the take a picture pictures with that now it has a basic zoom lens on it
641,"You can see it's very easy to use and if you wanted to isolate people in a depth of field affect, you can use the manual settings to open up the a aperture a bit more"
641,and this is a touch screen
641,yes it is
641,"and it's lightweight so if you're in cosplay you don't have to drag around a full camera kit with you, it's a little bit bigger than a camera that would fit in your pocket but it would fit in your cosplay handbag that so perfect"
641,"with the right lens on it you will get a really crisp shot, it's got a three-quarters sized sensor which doesn't mean it's smaller, it's more accurate the most sensor that's out on the market"
641,looks very good
641,Yes and the autofocus is also very accurate as well
641,"you can also take some longer exposure effect, the standard shutter speed goes up to 30 seconds"
641,okay sounds perfect thank you very much
641,no problem have a good afternoon
642,good afternoon how can I help?
642,oh hi I'm looking to take some pictures for my mountain climbing circle
642,Are they action pictures from the rock face
642,everything
642,"so you need something lightweight portable, incredibly easy to use it's going to be fun for circle party but you don't have to think about while you're hanging from a thread"
642,exactly you got it
642,ok we have two cameras that would fulfill your specification
642,"this camera here is only $68, it has full autofocus, it's got a nice of the lens on it, has 20 megapixel, is great for family and friends, it's great for those parties that's what its design for"
642,"if you're actually rock climbing, it only weighs 120 grams and because fully automatic, you don't have to think about too much you can use it one handed"
642,how is the weight on it
642,It's only 120 grams you can see it small enough to slip in the pocket
642,deserve a special grip to use
642,most of the rock climbers have custom grips with a tale of themselves but there was some accessories that would help you do that yes
642,"it has 20 megapixels in the sensor in a nice little lens so you're going to get some nice pictures from ,it I'll show you the next model up as well"
642,"if we look at the sony a6000 it takes pictures almost as good as a high end professional camera, but with its mirrorless design it's much lighter please pick it up and take some pictures"
642,can this be used with one hand too
642,"it's a little bit unbalanced because as you can see its got interchangeable lenses so it's always going to feel a bit front heavy, if you're actually trying to shoot while you are climbing"
642,The picture quality is fantastic but it will affect the way you approach the technical
642,"the autofocus is excellent, the quality of the picture is excellent, it is also pretty good in low light, so if you find yourself climbing in situations where it is a bit darker, the iso is 3200"
642,"but again that's a practical question of using it when you're actually climbing and the nikon itself with the 20 megapixel  sensor even though it has a reputation as a social camera, for your extreme application it's a very practical option"
642,"please take some pictures with this and with the nikon, see how they compare"
642,how's the pricing on this
642,550 dollars
642,that would buy a lot of rope and head home soon as well
642,mmm I think I'll have to think about it thank you very much anytime
642,anytime also checked out with your circle friends and have a look at some of the pictures I'll give you some ideas about what camera works best as well have a good afternoon
642,good afternoon to you too
643,good afternoon how can I help?
643,oh hi I'm looking to to buy camera to take pictures of my pets
643,"so it's more or less of family and friends, is that right?"
643,I don't really have many friends I have nine cats
643,cats are friends
643,"Please the nikon over here is only $68, and it's point and shoot fully automatic so for all those animal that like to move around and hold still you can get some really nice pictures"
643,just here you'll see me 5 times optical zoom
643,this takes videos too
643,yes it does
643,can I ask if you use your mobile phone to take pictures so far?
643,oh yes exclusively
643,so you noticed that annoying lag when you're trying to set up the phone thinks it knows better than you do
643,yes my cats always scratch up the lens
643,"you notice when you push the shutter on this, the effect is instant so just take a picture now and there is no lag"
643,that would make a big difference and help you capture that moment get their personality coming through the shot
643,very nice what colors does it come
643,black silver white red and purple
643,perfect my cats really like pink
643,"we have pink in stock, I should also mention it has its 20 megapixel sensor so you can get some really nice crisp shots that makes good enlargements up to  the size of a small poster"
643,It's only 68 dollars and it includes a few retouch effects as well do you use Facebook
643,oh yes I do
643,so you'll be able to put glitter on Kitty and so forth when you uploaded Facebook
643,if you like to use those sort of effects
643,That sounds fantastic
643,no problem come back anytime and you can give it more testing over it make sure we put a pink one for you
643,okay thank you very much
643,thank you
643,good afternoon
644,good afternoon how can I help?
644,oh hey just looking for a camera something more high end
644,can I ask what sort of pictures you like to take?
644,I'm trying to take pictures of of the night sky
644,star trails that sort of thing?
644,yes exactly
644,"there is really only one camera in the store that can handle a kind of application which is the Canon 5d mark 3, have you looked into the technicalities of how to do all of this that you do you have friends that you work with this"
644,no I just saw some cool pictures on the internet and I thought that's something I would like to do
644,"yes, one of the secrets of those pictures of going into a thing called bulb mode where you can have the shutter open for one minute, one hour, six hours, one week, if you want to and then have control so that you can stop it down so there's not too much light coming in"
644,this camera has that much full manual control full creative control to take astrophotography
644,nice what's the pricing on it
644,"this camera body is $2000, then the lenses are separate so they can cost anywhere from $500 up to quite incredible amounts if they're directing order by NASA as a one off"
644,wow that's pretty expensive is there a payment plan
644,"we can organize payment plans for you and also has a very generous warranty,  depending on how you want a package it up we can also organize some kind of deal as a set lenses are extra so depending on the lenses you want, we might be able to have a package discount"
644,um so what type of lens would you recommend for this type of photography
644,"I think maybe if we set you up with some lenses to have a practice, but also bring in some print, some examples of the work you admire that you'd like to follow"
644,yes that's a good idea
644,"we can work out from that what sort of lens they used, and we can package it up from there"
644,so should I set up an appointment
644,here is my business card and a brochure will you have time this weekend
644,I have time on Saturday afternoon
644,I'm on shift on Saturday between 11 and 7 so Saturday afternoon around about what time?
644,I'm not too sure yet I will give you a call then or if you just
644,sure thing or if you just come in I'll be here till 7 and I''ll make sure that there is a kit set up there that we can work with
644,that sounds perfect thank you very much have a good afternoon
644,okay see you saturday have a good afternoon
644,you too
